  "original_theorem": "Let $f: \\mathbb{R} \to \\mathbb{R}$ be differentiable. If $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, then $f$ is strictly increasing.",
  "original_proof": "Take any two points $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$ with $a < b$. By the Mean Value Theorem, there exists $c \\in (a, b)$ such that $f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}$. Since $f'(c) > 0$ by hypothesis and $b - a > 0$, we have $\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} > 0$. Therefore $f(b) - f(a) > 0$, which means $f(a) < f(b)$. Since this holds for any $a < b$, the function $f$ is strictly increasing.",
