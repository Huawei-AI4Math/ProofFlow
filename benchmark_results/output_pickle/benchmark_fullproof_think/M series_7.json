  "original_theorem": "Let $(a_n)$ be a sequence such that $a_n = \\frac{n+1}{2n+1}$. Then for all integers $n \\geq 1$, the inequality $\\frac{1}{2} < a_n \\leq \\frac{2}{3}$ holds.",
  "original_proof": "First, we prove the left-hand side of the inequality, $\\frac{1}{2} < a_n$. We are given $a_n = \\frac{n+1}{2n+1}$. To show $\\frac{1}{2} < \\frac{n+1}{2n+1}$, we can cross-multiply since both denominators are positive for $n \\geq 1$. This gives us $1(2n+1) < 2(n+1)$, which simplifies to $2n+1 < 2n+2$. Subtracting $2n$ from both sides gives $1 < 2$, which is a true statement. Therefore, $\\frac{1}{2} < a_n$ holds for all $n \\geq 1$. Next, we prove the right-hand side of the inequality, $a_n \\leq \\frac{2}{3}$. We need to show that $\\frac{n+1}{2n+1} \\leq \\frac{2}{3}$. Again, we can cross-multiply to get $3(n+1) \\leq 2(2n+1)$. This simplifies to $3n+3 \\leq 4n+2$. Subtracting $3n$ and $2$ from both sides gives $1 \\leq n$. This is true for all integers $n \\geq 1$. Since both parts of the inequality hold, the full inequality $\\frac{1}{2} < a_n \\leq \\frac{2}{3}$ is proven.",
