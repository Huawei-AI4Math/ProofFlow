  "original_theorem": "Let $C$ be the circle $|z|=2$ oriented counter-clockwise and let the function to be integrated be $f(z) = \\frac{\\cos(z)}{z-i}$. If Cauchy's Integral Formula, $\\oint_C \\frac{g(z)}{z-z_0} dz = 2\\pi i g(z_0)$, holds for any function $g(z)$ that is analytic inside and on $C$ and any point $z_0$ inside $C$, then $\\oint_C f(z) dz = 2\\pi i \\cosh(1)$.",
  "original_proof": "To apply the given formula, we first identify the components of $f(z) = \\frac{\\cos(z)}{z-i}$ as $g(z) = \\cos(z)$ and $z_0 = i$. We must verify the conditions of the formula. The singularity $z_0=i$ lies inside the contour $C$ since its modulus $|i|=1$ is less than the radius 2. The function $g(z)=\\cos(z)$ is analytic on the entire complex plane, and thus is analytic on and inside $C$. With the conditions verified, we can apply the formula: $\\oint_C f(z) dz = 2\\pi i g(i) = 2\\pi i \\cos(i)$. Using the identity $\\cos(i) = \\cosh(1)$, we find the integral is equal to $2\\pi i \\cosh(1)$.",
