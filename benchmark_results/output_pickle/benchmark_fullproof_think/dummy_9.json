  "original_theorem": "If $(a_n)$ is an arithmetic sequence with $a_1 = 5$ and $a_3 = 11$, then $a_5 = 17$.",
  "original_proof": "Since $(a_n)$ is arithmetic, there exists a common difference $d$ such that $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$ for all $n$. From the given information, $a_3 = a_1 + 2d$. Substituting the values: $11 = 5 + 2d$, which gives us $2d = 6$, so $d = 3$. Now we can find $a_5 = a_1 + 4d = 5 + 4(3) = 5 + 12 = 17$",
