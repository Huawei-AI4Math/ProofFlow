  "original_proof": "From the conditions $\\operatorname{Re}(z) = 2$ and $\\operatorname{Im}(z) = 3$, we can write $z = 2+3i$. We then compute the square of $z$, which is $z^2 = (2+3i)^2 = -5+12i$. Now we consider the expression $e^{z^2}$, which is $e^{-5+12i}$. The modulus of a complex exponential $e^{a+ib}$ is $e^a$, so we find that $|e^{z^2}| = |e^{-5+12i}| = e^{-5}$.",
