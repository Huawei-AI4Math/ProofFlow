  "original_proof": "We want to prove that $x^{4}+y^{4}+z^{2}+1 \\ge 2x(xy^{2}-x+z+1)$ for all real numbers $x, y, z$. Rearranging the inequality and expanding gives $x^{4}+y^{4}+z^{2}+1 - 2x(xy^{2}-x+z+1) = x^{4}+y^{4}-2x^2y^2 + 2x^2 + z^2 - 2xz + x^2 - 2x + 1$. This expression can be grouped as $(x^2-y^2)^2 + (x-z)^2 + (x-1)^2$, which is clearly non-negative since each term is a square. Therefore, the inequality holds for all real numbers $x, y, z$.",
