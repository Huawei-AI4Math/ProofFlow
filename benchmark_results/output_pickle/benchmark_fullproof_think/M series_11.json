  "original_theorem": "Let $(a_n)$ be a sequence defined by $a_1=1$ and the recurrence relation $a_{n+1} = \\sqrt{2a_n+3}$. Prove that for all integers $n \\geq 1$, the inequality $a_n < 3$ holds.",
  "original_proof": "We will prove this by mathematical induction on $n$. First, for the base case $n=1$, we are given $a_1=1$. Since $1 < 3$, the inequality holds. Now, for the inductive step, we assume the statement is true for some integer $k \\geq 1$, which means $a_k < 3$. We want to show that the statement is true for $k+1$, i.e., $a_{k+1} < 3$. We have the recurrence relation $a_{k+1} = \\sqrt{2a_k+3}$. From the inductive hypothesis, we know that $a_k < 3$. We can multiply this inequality by 2 to get $2a_k < 6$. Adding 3 to both sides gives $2a_k+3 < 9$. Taking the square root of both sides gives $\\sqrt{2a_k+3} < \\sqrt{9}$. This simplifies to $a_{k+1} < 3$. Since the statement is true for $k+1$, by the principle of mathematical induction, the inequality $a_n < 3$ holds for all integers $n \\geq 1$.",

        "llm_response": "An analysis of the provided Lean 4 code and its error messages indicates several issues, likely stemming from a combination of tactic misuse and potentially misleading error reports from a specific Lean environment. The core problems are:\n1.  A tactic is too powerful and solves the goal prematurely, leaving a subsequent tactic with \"no goals to be solved\".\n2.  A tactic is not powerful enough for the given goal, leading to a failure that was unexpectedly reported as \"no goals to be solved\".\n3.  A tactic fails for unclear reasons (possibly environment-specific), leading to an \"unsolved goals\" error on a goal that should be provable.\n\nThe following corrections address these issues by selecting more precise tactics to match the intended proof steps, ensuring each tactic has a well-defined goal to solve.\n\n1.  In `an_nonneg`, `simp [a]` is replaced by `simp only [a]`. The `simp` tactic can sometimes be too powerful, using lemmas beyond simple definitions. Using `simp only [a]` ensures only the definition of the sequence `a` is unfolded, leaving the rest of the proof to be handled deliberately by `apply Real.sqrt_nonneg` and `linarith`.\n2.  In the base case of `an_lt_3`, the original code had `simp [a]` followed by `norm_num`. `simp` is capable of solving `1 < 3` by itself, which makes the subsequent `norm_num` redundant and causes the \"no goals to be solved\" error. To preserve the two-step logic implied by the comments (first unfold `a 0`, then prove the inequality), `simp [a]` is changed to `rw [a]`. `rw` only performs the substitution, leaving the goal `1 < 3` for `norm_num` to solve.\n3.  In the `calc` block of `an_lt_3`, the step `_ = Real.sqrt 9 := by norm_num` is problematic because `norm_num` does not typically simplify expressions inside functions like `Real.sqrt`. The correct tactic for this is `simp`, which can apply simplification rules inside function arguments.\n4.  The final step `_ = 3 := by norm_num` was reported to have an \"unsolved goals\" error, which is unexpected as `norm_num` is designed to handle `Real.sqrt 9 = 3`. While this might be an environment-specific issue, to ensure robustness, this is also changed to `simp`. The `simp` tactic correctly uses the lemma `Real.sqrt_9` to complete the proof.\n\nThese changes make the proof more robust and correct while staying true to the structure of the original informal proof.\n\n```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat Filter\n\n-- To represent the sequence (a_n) in Lean, we define a function `a : ℕ → ℝ`.\n-- The problem uses 1-based indexing (a_1, a_2, ...), but Lean's `ℕ` is 0-indexed (0, 1, ...).\n-- We re-index the sequence for a more natural definition in Lean:\n-- Our `a n` will correspond to the problem's a_{n+1}.\n-- Problem: a₁ = 1, a_{n+1} = √(2aₙ + 3)\n-- Lean def: a 0 = 1, a (n + 1) = √(2(a n) + 3)\n-- The function must be marked `noncomputable` because `Real.sqrt` is not computable.\nnoncomputable def a : ℕ → ℝ\n  | 0 => 1\n  | n + 1 => Real.sqrt (2 * a n + 3)\n\n-- A helper lemma is needed to show that `a n` is always non-negative.\n-- This is crucial for two reasons:\n-- 1.
