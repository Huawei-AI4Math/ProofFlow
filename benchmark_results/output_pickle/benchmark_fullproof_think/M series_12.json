  "original_theorem": "Let $(a_n)$ be a sequence defined by $a_1=1$ and the recurrence relation $a_{n+1}=3a_n-2$. Let $(b_n)$ be a sequence defined by $b_1=3$ and the recurrence relation $b_{n+1}=2b_n+1$. Prove that for all integers $n \\geq 1$, the inequality $a_n < b_n$ holds.",
  "original_proof": "First, we find the explicit formulas for the terms of both sequences and then showing the inequality holds. For the sequence $(a_n)$, we have $a_1=1$. For $n=1$, $a_2=3a_1-2=3(1)-2=1$. For $n=2$, $a_3=3a_2-2=3(1)-2=1$. By induction, we can show that $a_n=1$ for all $n \\geq 1$. For the sequence $(b_n)$, we have $b_1=3$. We can show that $b_n=2^{n+1}-1$ by induction. For the base case $n=1$, $b_1=2^{1+1}-1=2^2-1=3$ holds. Assume $b_k=2^{k+1}-1$ for some $k \\geq 1$. Then $b_{k+1}=2b_k+1=2(2^{k+1}-1)+1=2^{k+2}-2+1=2^{k+2}-1$. So $b_{k+1}=2^{(k+1)+1}-1$ holds. Thus $b_n=2^{n+1}-1$ for all $n \\geq 1$. Now we need to prove the inequality $a_n < b_n$. Substituting our explicit formulas, we need to show that $1 < 2^{n+1}-1$. This is equivalent to showing $2 < 2^{n+1}$, which is $1 < 2^n$. This inequality holds for all integers $n \\geq 1$. Therefore, the inequality $a_n < b_n$ holds for all integers $n \\geq 1$.",
