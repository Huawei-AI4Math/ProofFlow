  "original_proof": "First, we find the expression for the sequence $(c_n)$ by adding the expressions for $a_n$ and $b_n$, which gives $c_n = (n+1) + 2n^2$. Next, we find the values for the first two terms: $c_1 = (1+1) + 2(1)^2 = 4$ and $c_2 = (2+1) + 2(2)^2 = 11$. Finally, we sum these two terms to get $\\sum_{n=1}^{2} c_n = c_1+c_2=4+11=15$.",

A target formalization in Lean 4, which is claimed to have errors.\n4.  Specific error messages from the Lean compiler.\n\nThe error message is:\n```\ntactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression\n  ∑ k ∈ Finset.Icc ?m.843 (?m.844 + 1), ?f k\n⊢ let a := fun n => n + 1;\n  let b := fun n => 2 * n ^ 2;\n  let c := fun n => a n + b n;\n  ∑ n ∈ Finset.Icc 1 2, c n = 15\n```\nThis error occurs at `rw [Finset.sum_Icc_succ_top (by decide)]`.\n\nThe problem is that the `let` expressions are part of the *goal*, not part of the *context*. `rw` (and other tactics) operate on the goal *after* the `⊢`. The `let` expressions are in front of it. This means the `∑` expression is not at the top level of the goal, but is nested inside the `let` expressions.\n\nLet's look at the theorem statement:\n```lean4\ntheorem sum_of_sequence_is_15 :\n  let a := fun n : ℕ ↦ n + 1\n  let b := fun n : ℕ ↦ 2 * n ^ 2\n  let c := fun n : ℕ ↦ a n + b n\n  ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, c n = 15 := by\n  ...\n```\nThis structure is a bit unusual. The `let` bindings are part of the *type* of the theorem, not hypotheses. When a proof starts with `by`, Lean moves what's after the `:=` to the goal. So the goal is literally:\n`let a := fun n => n + 1; let b := ...; let c := ...; ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, c n = 15`\n\nTactics like `rw` will try to match on the whole expression. `Finset.sum_Icc_succ_top` has the form `∑ i in Icc m (n+1), f i = (∑ i in Icc m n, f i) + f (n+1)`. The `rw` tactic is looking for a term of the form `∑ i in Icc m (n+1), f i`, but the goal is `let ... in ...`.\n\nThere are two main ways to fix this.\n\n1.  **Move the `let` bindings outside the theorem statement.** This is the most common and idiomatic way to define things.\n    ```lean4\n    def a (n : ℕ) : ℕ := n + 1\n    def b (n : ℕ) : ℕ := 2 * n ^ 2\n    def c (n : ℕ) : ℕ := a n + b n\n\n    theorem sum_of_sequence_is_15 :\n      ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, c n = 15 := by\n      ...\n    ```\n    Or using `let`s in a `where` clause:\n    ```lean4\n    theorem sum_of_sequence_is_15 :\n      ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, c n = 15 := by\n      ...\n    where\n      a (n : ℕ) : ℕ := n + 1\n      b (n : ℕ) : ℕ := 2 * n ^ 2\n      c (n : ℕ) : ℕ := a n + b n\n    ```\n    This is probably the cleanest approach.\n\n2.  **Deal with the `let`s inside the proof.** A tactic is needed to \"see through\" or \"unfold\" the `let` expressions. The `dsimp` tactic can often simplify `let` expressions. Or `unfold` can be used on the names `a`, `b`, `c`. However, they are not definitions, they are local bindings. Often, just starting the proof will reduce `let`s. Let's try to `intros` or `rfl` or simplify things.\n    The `let` expression `let x := v; e` is definitionally equal to `e` with all `x`s replaced by `v`. Lean's kernel knows this, but some tactics don't look through it. `dsimp` is designed to simplify expressions without proving anything, which includes unfolding `let`s.\n\n    Let's try stepping through the proof in my head with the original structure.\n    Goal: `let a := ...; let b := ...; let c := ...; ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, c n = 15`\n    The first tactic is `rw [Finset.sum_Icc_succ_top (by decide)]`. This fails as explained.\n\n    What if we simplify first? `dsimp` might work.\n    ```lean4\n    theorem sum_of_sequence_is_15 :\n      let a := fun n : ℕ ↦ n + 1\n      let b := fun n : ℕ ↦ 2 * n ^ 2\n      let c := fun n : ℕ ↦ a n + b n\n      ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, c n = 15 := by\n      dsimp\n      -- Goal: ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, (n + 1) + 2 * n ^ 2 = 15\n    ```\n    After `dsimp`, the `let` expressions are gone and `c` is expanded. This looks promising. Now the goal is a plain summation. Let's try the original proof from this point.\n    `rw [Finset.sum_Icc_succ_top (by decide)]`\n    The goal becomes `(∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 1, (n + 1) + 2 * n ^ 2) + ((2 + 1) + 2 * 2 ^ 2) = 15`.\n    `rw [Finset.sum_Icc_self]`\n    The goal becomes `((1 + 1) + 2 * 1 ^ 2) + ((2 + 1) + 2 * 2 ^ 2) = 15`.\n    `norm_num`\n    This should compute `(2 + 2) + (3 + 8) = 4 + 11 = 15` and close the goal.\n\n    So, one fix is to add `dsimp` at the beginning. This changes the proof strategy slightly from the provided commentary. The commentary suggests unfolding `c` later.\n\n    Let's try another approach that sticks closer to the commentary. The commentary wants to treat `c` as an opaque function and prove lemmas about `c 1` and `c 2`.\n    The problem is that `c` is not a hypothesis. The `let ... in ...` expression is a bit tricky. Maybe `let` can be used inside the `by` block.\n\n    ```lean4\n    theorem sum_of_sequence_is_15 :\n      -- This statement is now clean.\n      ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, c n = 15 := by\n      -- Define c inside the proof.\n      let a := fun n : ℕ ↦ n + 1\n      let b := fun n : ℕ ↦ 2 * n ^ 2\n      let c := fun n : ℕ ↦ a n + b n\n      -- But now the `c` in the goal is not the same `c` we just defined.\n      -- So this is not right.\n    ```\n\n    The `let` has to be moved before the colon.\n    ```lean4\n    theorem sum_of_sequence_is_15 : ... :=\n    begin\n      ... -- old-style tactic mode\n    end\n    ```\n    This is deprecated. Let's stick to tactic blocks.\n\n    Let's go back to the original structure.\n    ```lean4\n    theorem sum_of_sequence_is_15 :\n      let a := fun n : ℕ ↦ n + 1\n      let b := fun n : ℕ ↦ 2 * n ^ 2\n      let c := fun n : ℕ ↦ a n + b n\n      ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, c n = 15 := by ...\n    ```\n    The problem is that the `let` bindings are \"stuck\" in the goal type. A tactic to introduce them into the local context is `let_intro`. No, that's not a standard tactic. The `intro` tactic can sometimes do this. What about `refine`?\n\n    Let's try another path. The user's commentary is good and seems to be the intended solution. The problem is that the first tactic fails. Why does it fail? Because `rw` doesn't see through `let`.\n\n    A different way to expand the sum:\n    `Finset.sum_Icc_of_le (by decide)` expands `∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, c n` to `c 1 + c 2`. This is simpler than using `sum_Icc_succ_top` and `sum_Icc_self`. Let's check `Mathlib`.\n    Ah, there isn't a single lemma like that. But `Finset.sum_range_succ` is a common pattern. `Icc 1 2` is `{1, 2}`.\n    `Finset.sum_image`? `Finset.sum_insert`?\n    `Finset.Icc 1 2` is `insert 2 (Finset.Icc 1 1)`.\n    So we could use `rw [Finset.sum_insert ...]`\n    ```lean4\n    rw [Finset.sum_insert] -- requires a proof that 2 is not in Icc 1 1. That's `Finset.not_mem_Icc_self`.\n    -- gives error, need to provide proof `2 ∉ Finset.Icc 1 1`\n    have h : 2 ∉ Finset.Icc 1 1 := by simp\n    -- the rewrite gets complicated.\n\n    Let me reconsider the original approach with `sum_Icc_succ_top`.\n    The goal is `let ... in (∑ ... = 15)`.\n    What if we simplify the expression inside the `let` bindings first?\n    The issue is that the `rw` is trying to match `∑ k ∈ Finset.Icc ?m (?n + 1), ?f k`.\n    The term in the goal is `∑ n ∈ Finset.Icc 1 2, c n`. Here `2` is `1+1`. So the pattern should match. But it's inside a `let`.\n\n    Maybe `simp` can help. `simp only [Finset.sum_Icc_succ_top (by decide)]` might work where `rw` fails, as `simp` can sometimes enter binders. Let's try that.\n    Okay, the error message indicates the problem is the `let`s. Tactics operate on the goal. The goal is `let a...`. It's not a sum.\n    The `let` keyword inside a theorem type is a bit unusual.\n\n    Let's try to change the structure of the theorem to what Lean expects.\n    Either define `a, b, c` globally (or locally to a section).\n    ```lean4\n    section\n    def a (n : ℕ) : ℕ := n + 1\n    def b (n : ℕ) : ℕ := 2 * n ^ 2\n    def c (n : ℕ) : ℕ := a n + b n\n\n    theorem sum_of_sequence_is_15 :\n      ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, c n = 15 := by\n      -- The proof should now work.\n      rw [Finset.sum_Icc_succ_top (by decide)]\n      rw [Finset.sum_Icc_self]\n      -- Goal: `c 1 + c 2 = 15`\n      have hc1 : c 1 = 4 := by\n        unfold c a b\n        norm_num\n      have hc2 : c 2 = 11 := by\n        unfold c a b\n        norm_num\n      rw [hc1, hc2]\n      norm_num\n    end\n    ```\n    This works. But maybe the user wants to keep the `let` form. The user provided \"Target Formal Problem Statement and Proof\", which I must correct. I shouldn't change the statement if possible.\n\n    Let's analyze the `let` statement problem again.\n    `theorem foo : let x := 1; x = 1 := by simp`\n    This works. `simp` is powerful.\n    What about `rw`?\n    `theorem foo : let x := 1; x = 1 := by {let_unfold; rw ...}`. There is no `let_unfold`.\n\n    The problem is that the `let`s are in the *type*.\n    `example : let x := 1; x = 1 := rfl` works.\n    `example : let x := 1+1; x = 2 := rfl` works.\n    `example : let f := fun x => x+1; f 1 = 2 := rfl` works.\n\n    Let's try again with the original statement.\n    ```lean4\n    theorem sum_of_sequence_is_15 :\n      let a := fun n : ℕ ↦ n + 1\n      let b := fun n : ℕ ↦ 2 * n ^ 2\n      let c := fun n : ℕ ↦ a n + b n\n      ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, c n = 15 := by\n      -- Goal: let a := ... in let b := ... in let c := ... in ∑ n in Icc 1 2, c n = 15\n    ```\n    The `rw` is failing. What if we use a different tactic to start?\n    `simp` is too powerful, it might solve the whole thing. `simp only [...]` is an option.\n    How about `unfold c a b` at the very beginning?\n    ```lean4\n    theorem sum_of_sequence_is_15 :\n      let a := fun n : ℕ ↦ n + 1\n      let b := fun n : ℕ ↦ 2 * n ^ 2\n      let c := fun n : ℕ ↦ a n + b n\n      ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, c n = 15 := by\n      unfold c a b\n      -- Goal: ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, (n + 1) + 2 * n^2 = 15\n      -- Now the goal is a pure sum. The rest of the proof might work,\n      -- but it was structured around `c`.\n    ```\n    If we do this, the rest of the proof needs to be adapted.\n    ```lean4\n      unfold c a b\n      rw [Finset.sum_Icc_succ_top (by decide)]\n      rw [Finset.sum_Icc_self]\n      -- Goal: ((1 + 1) + 2 * 1^2) + ((2 + 1) + 2 * 2^2) = 15\n      norm_num\n    ```\n    This is a valid proof, but it deviates significantly from the provided commentary's structure (`have hc1 : c 1 = 4`, etc.). The user wants the corrected proof to follow the commentary.\n\n    So, how can we unfold the `let`s to make `a, b, c` available as local definitions in the context?\n    The tactic `conv` can be used to navigate to a subexpression.\n    `conv => lhs; ...` would focus on the left-hand side.\n    `conv => lhs; unfold c a b` doesn't work because `c`, `a`, `b` are not defined. They are bound variables in the `let` expression.\n\n    A key insight is that `let x := v in e` is definitionally equal to `(fun x ↦ e) v`.\n    So the goal is weird.\n    What if we start with `rfl`? No, it's not provable by `rfl`.\n\n    Let's look at the failing line again: `rw [Finset.sum_Icc_succ_top (by decide)]`.\n    The error says it can't find the pattern `∑ k ∈ Finset.Icc ?m.843 (?m.844 + 1), ?f k`.\n    This implies the `let` expressions are indeed the problem.\n\n    A simple way to deal with `let` in the goal is to use `dsimp`. But as we established, this changes the goal too much for the rest of the proof.\n\n    Is there a tactic to move `let` expressions from the goal into the context? Like `let a := ...; have a := a`.\n    I think the best way to preserve the spirit of the proof is to rephrase the theorem statement itself. The provided statement is syntactically valid but tactically awkward. Good Lean style would be to define `a`, `b`, `c` outside or using `where`.\n\n    The user says \"correct the previous response\". My job may be to simply fix the error, even if it means deviating from the commentary, as long as it's a small deviation. The `dsimp` fix is quite small.\n\n    Let's try building a proof using `dsimp`.\n    ```lean4\n    theorem sum_of_sequence_is_15 :\n      let a := fun n : ℕ ↦ n + 1\n      let b := fun n : ℕ ↦ 2 * n ^ 2\n      let c := fun n : ℕ ↦ a n + b n\n      ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, c n = 15 := by\n      dsimp\n      -- Goal: ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, n + 1 + 2 * n ^ 2 = 15\n      -- Now we can't talk about 'c' anymore.\n      -- So `have hc1 : c 1 = 4` is not going to work.\n      -- The commentary is now invalid.\n    ```\n    This is not a good fix. It doesn't respect the user's provided proof structure.\n\n    The problem is the user-provided 'Target Formal Problem Statement'. It's awkward.\n    If I change it, am I failing the user? The instruction is \"translate the informal problem into a formal theorem statement\". Maybe the provided target is just a bad translation.\n    Let's look at the informal problem.\n    \"Let $(a_n)$ be a sequence such that $a_n = n+1$ and $(b_n)$ be a sequence such that $b_n = 2n^2$. Let the sequence $(c_n)$ be defined as $c_n = a_n+b_n$.\"\n    This suggests making `a`, `b`, `c` hypotheses, or definitions available in the context.\n\n    Possibility 1: Make them hypotheses.\n    ```lean4\n    theorem sum_of_sequence_is_15\n      (a : ℕ → ℕ) (h_a : a = fun n ↦ n + 1)\n      (b : ℕ → ℕ) (h_b : b = fun n ↦ 2 * n ^ 2)\n      (c : ℕ → ℕ) (h_c : c = fun n ↦ a n + b n)\n      : ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, c n = 15 := by\n      subst_vars -- substitutes a, b, c with their definitions\n      -- Now goal is ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, (n + 1) + 2 * n ^ 2 = 15\n      -- Same problem as dsimp: `c` is gone.\n    ```\n\n    Possibility 2: Use `let` in the `by` block.\n    ```lean4\n    theorem sum_of_sequence_is_15 :\n      let a := fun n : ℕ ↦ n + 1;\n      let b := fun n : ℕ ↦ 2 * n ^ 2;\n      ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, (a n + b n) = 15 := by\n      -- This avoids the `let c` which is the problematic one for `have hc1 : c 1=...`\n      -- let's try this\n      let a := fun n : ℕ ↦ n + 1\n      let b := fun n : ℕ ↦ 2 * n ^ 2\n      let c := fun n : ℕ ↦ a n + b n\n      -- But the goal doesn't mention `c`.\n      -- The goal mentions `a` and `b` but they are local to the theorem statement.\n      -- This is getting confusing.\n    ```\n\n    The original user-provided code is almost certainly trying to do something that is better done by putting the definitions outside the `theorem` statement.\n    Let's go back to the error. Is there any other way to fix it?\n    The error is `tactic 'rewrite' failed`. This is because the pattern doesn't match `let ... in ...`.\n\n    What if we use `simp only`? `simp` is smarter about `let`.\n    ```lean4\n    theorem sum_of_sequence_is_15 :\n      let a := fun n : ℕ ↦ n + 1\n      let b := fun n : ℕ ↦ 2 * n ^ 2\n      let c := fun n : ℕ ↦ a n + b n\n      ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, c n = 15 := by\n      simp only [Finset.sum_Icc_succ_top (by decide)]\n      -- If this works, the goal would be:\n      -- let a := ..., let b := ..., let c := ... in (∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 1, c n) + c 2 = 15\n      simp only [Finset.sum_Icc_self]\n      -- Goal: let a := ..., let b := ..., let c := ... in c 1 + c 2 = 15\n      -- This looks promising! `simp only` might be the key.\n    ```\n    I will try this. Let me verify that `simp only` works this way. Yes, `simp` can work inside binders and `let` expressions.\n    So, after those two lines:\n    Goal: `let a := fun n ↦ n + 1; let b := fun n ↦ 2 * n ^ 2; let c := fun n ↦ a n + b n; c 1 + c 2 = 15`\n    Now we need to prove `have hc1 : c 1 = 4`. But `c` is not in context. The `let`s are still in the goal type. `have` will not work.\n    So the original proof had `have hc1...`. This tactic adds a new hypothesis to the local context. `c` is not in the local context.\n\n    So, `simp only` is also not the solution if we want to follow the rest of the proof. The problem is deeper. The `let`s must be moved to the context.\n\n    How to move `let` expressions from goal to context?\n    The tactic `pattern` can be used to abstract over parts of the goal.\n    `pattern (fun c => ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, c n = 15)` maybe? This seems too complex.\n\n    There is a tactic `let_trans` for `calc`. But that's not relevant.\n\n    Let's try something simple. What if we just declare what we want to prove inside the larger `let` expression?\n    ```lean4\n    theorem sum_of_sequence_is_15 :\n      let a := fun n : ℕ ↦ n + 1\n      let b := fun n : ℕ ↦ 2 * n ^ 2\n      let c := fun n : ℕ ↦ a n + b n\n      ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, c n = 15 := by\n      let_move a, b, c -- this tactic doesn't exist.\n    ```\n\n    Let's think about the structure again.\n    `theorem name : P := proof`\n    Here `P` is `let a := ... in ...`. This is a `Prop`.\n    When the proof starts, the goal is `P`.\n    The only sane way to prove this is to simplify `P` until it becomes something tractable. `dsimp` is the canonical way to do this.\n    `unfold c a b` is also a way.\n\n    The commentary says:\n    > The informal proof expands the sum as c₁ + c₂. We mirror this by expanding the sum over the interval Finset.Icc 1 2, which is the set {1, 2}. We use Finset.sum_Icc_succ_top...\n\n    This first step is the one that's failing. The commentary is describing a proof for a goal of the form `∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, c n = 15`. It has forgotten about the `let`s.\n\n    So the commentary itself is slightly incorrect in its description of the Lean tactics relative to the goal state.\n\n    What if we just use a more direct expansion of the sum?\n    `Finset.Icc 1 2` is `{1, 2}`. A property of `Finset.sum` is that `sum {1,2} f = f 1 + f 2`.\n    We can rewrite `Finset.Icc 1 2` into `insert 2 (insert 1 {})`.\n    `rw [show Finset.Icc 1 2 = {1, 2} from by rfl]`\n    Then `rw [Finset.sum_pair (by decide)]` (assuming `1 ≠ 2`).\n    Let's try this line of attack.\n\n    ```lean4\n    theorem sum_of_sequence_is_15 :\n      let a := fun n : ℕ ↦ n + 1\n      let b := fun n : ℕ ↦ 2 * n ^ 2\n      let c := fun n : ℕ ↦ a n + b n\n      ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, c n = 15 := by\n      -- The goal has `let`s. Let's get rid of them.\n      -- The simplest way is to substitute them into the expression.\n      -- `dsimp` does this.\n      dsimp\n      -- Goal: ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, (n + 1 + 2 * n ^ 2) = 15\n      -- Now the original proof commentary about `c` is invalid.\n      -- Let's write a new proof and new commentary.\n\n      -- A more direct proof: `norm_num` is powerful enough.\n      -- `norm_num` can evaluate sums.\n      norm_num -- This might solve it in one go.\n    ```\n    If `norm_num` solves it, the proof would be very short. It might be too \"magic\".\n\n    Let's try to stick to the user's proof structure as much as possible.\n    The key seems to be the `have hc1 : c 1 = 4` part. For that to work, `c` has to be a local constant.\n    This means the `let`s MUST be brought into the context.\n\n    How to do that?\n    The `let` expression in the proposition is just a very strange way to write it. Perhaps it can be rewritten.\n    The theorem statement is definitionally equal to:\n    `theorem sum_of_sequence_is_15 : (fun a b c => ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, c n = 15) (fun n => n+1) (fun n => 2*n^2) (fun n => (fun n => n+1) n + (fun n => 2*n^2) n) := ...`\n    This is not helpful.\n\n    What if we just change the statement to the standard form?\n    ```lean4\n    theorem sum_of_sequence_is_15 :\n      let a := fun n : ℕ ↦ n + 1\n      let b := fun n : ℕ ↦ 2 * n ^ 2\n      let c := fun n : ℕ ↦ a n + b n\n      ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, c n = 15 :=\n    by\n      rfl\n    ```\n    This doesn't work. The goal is `(2 * 1 ^ 2 + (1 + 1)) + (2 * 2 ^ 2 + (2 + 1)) = 15` which is `(2+2) + (8+3) = 4 + 11 = 15`, which is true. But `rfl` doesn't do computation. `native_compute` or `norm_num` does.\n\n    So, `theorem ... := by norm_num` would work. It's a valid proof. It's short. But it does not follow the informal proof.\n\n    The user has a strong hint in the prompt: \"The previous Lean4 code I sent you contains errors. Please take that into account.\" and \"Based on these errors, please correct the previous response.\" This means I should not throw away the whole thing, but surgically fix it.\n\n    The error is on `rw [Finset.sum_Icc_succ_top (by decide)]`.\n    The cause is the `let`s in the goal.\n    How to make `rw` work? It needs to see `∑...`.\n    The only way for that to happen is to remove the `let`s.\n    The only way to remove the `let`s without changing the goal's meaning too much (and invalidating later steps) is to... well, there's no way. If we remove the `let`s, we substitute `c`, and `c` is gone.\n\n    Maybe the `have` part is the problem.\n    Is it possible to prove `c 1 = 4` inside this weird 'let' goal?\n    `have hc1 : (let a := ...; let b := ...; let c := ...; c 1) = 4` ? This is getting crazy.\n\n    Let's take a step back and think about the user's intent. They want a pedagogical proof that mirrors the informal steps.\n    1. Expand sum: `∑ c_n = c_1 + c_2`\n    2. Calc `c_1`: `c_1 = 4`\n    3. Calc `c_2`: `c_2 = 11`\n    4. Substitute and conclude: `4 + 11 = 15`\n\n    The `let` in the proposition is the main obstacle. It's syntactically valid but hard to work with using elementary tactics. A professional might use `conv` or `meta` programming, but that's not the goal here. The goal is a clear, step-by-step proof.\n\n    This strongly suggests the theorem statement should be changed. The user's provided \"Target Formal Problem Statement\" is flawed. My job is to correct the whole thing, including the statement if it's the source of the problem.\n\n    Let me propose a new statement and a proof that follows the commentary.\n    ```lean4\n    theorem sum_of_sequence_is_15 :\n      let a := fun n : ℕ ↦ n + 1;\n      let b := fun n : ℕ ↦ 2 * n ^ 2;\n      let c := fun n : ℕ ↦ a n + b n;\n      ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, c n = 15 := by\n      simp [let_body] -- No such thing\n    ```\n    Is there a `simp` lemma to unfold `let`? Yes. `let_congr`. This is not what I want. Beta reduction `(fun x => e) v` -> `e[v/x]` is what `dsimp` does.\n\n    Let's try a different idea. Simplify the sum in a different way.\n    Instead of `Finset.sum_Icc_succ_top`, what about `Finset.sum_fin_eq` to rewrite the sum over `Fin 2`? `Finset.Icc 1 2` is not `Fin 2`.\n    How about `sum_univ_cast_succ`. No.\n\n    What about just writing out the sum?\n    `change (c 1 + c 2) = 15` is a potential tactic. But `c` is not in the context.\n    However, the goal is `let c := ... in ∑ n in {1,2}, c n = 15`. This is def-eq to `let c := ... in c 1 + c 2 = 15`. So `change` might work if it's clever enough. It would need a proof that `∑ n in Icc 1 2, c n = c 1 + c 2`.\n\n    `change (let a := ...; let b := ...; let c := ...; c 1 + c 2) = 15`.\n    This `change` is getting complicated.\n\n    Let's re-read the error.\n    `tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression ∑ k ∈ Finset.Icc ?m.843 (?m.844 + 1), ?f k`\n    This means the goal is NOT of this form. Because the goal is `let ... in ...`.\n\n    This is a hard constraint. Any tactic that needs to match on the sum will fail. This includes `rw`, `simp only [lemma]`, `dsimp only [lemma]`.\n\n    A different approach: `calc` block.\n    ```lean4\n    theorem sum_of_sequence_is_15 :\n      let a := fun n : ℕ ↦ n + 1\n      let b := fun n : ℕ ↦ 2 * n ^ 2\n      let c := fun n : ℕ ↦ a n + b n\n      ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, c n = 15 := by\n      calc\n        ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, c n = c 1 + c 2 := by\n          -- proof for this step\n          rw [Finset.sum_Icc_succ_top (by decide), Finset.sum_Icc_self]\n        _ = 4 + 11 := by\n          -- proof for this step\n          have hc1 : c 1 = 4 := by unfold c a b; norm_num\n          have hc2 : c 2 = 11 := by unfold c a b; norm_num\n          rw [hc1, hc2]\n        _ = 15 := by\n          norm_num\n    ```\n    This `calc` proof structure is nice. But will it work with the `let`s?\n    The first sub-goal is `(let ... in ∑...) = (let ... in (c 1 + c 2))`.\n    The `rw` in the subproof will still fail!\n\n    This is frustrating. The problem seems to be an impedance mismatch between the user's desired proof flow and the specific form of the theorem statement.\n\n    There is a way to make the `let`s local. It's to not have them in the proposition.\n    ```lean4\n    theorem sum_of_sequence_is_15 :\n      (fun (a : ℕ → ℕ) (b : ℕ → ℕ) (c : ℕ → ℕ) =>\n        (a = fun n ↦ n + 1) →\n        (b = fun n ↦ 2 * n ^ 2) →\n        (c = fun n ↦ a n + b n) →\n        ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, c n = 15)\n      (fun n ↦ n + 1) (fun n ↦ 2 * n ^ 2) (fun n ↦ (fun n ↦ n + 1) n + (fun n ↦ 2 * n ^ 2) n)\n      rfl rfl rfl := by\n        intros a b c ha hb hc\n        subst_vars\n        norm_num\n    ```\n    This is insane. I should not do this.\n\n    The simplest fix is to change the theorem statement to a more standard form. It still qualifies as a \"translation\" of the informal problem.\n    The instruction says \"First translate the informal problem into a formal theorem statement\". The provided \"Target Formal Problem Statement\" might be just a suggestion or a part of the buggy code to fix. So I am allowed to change it.\n\n    Modified Statement:\n    ```lean4\n    theorem sum_of_sequence_is_15 :\n      let a := fun n : ℕ ↦ n + 1\n      let b := fun n : ℕ ↦ 2 * n ^ 2\n      let c := fun n : ℕ ↦ a n + b n\n      ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, c n = 15 :=\n    by\n      -- proof\n    ```\n    This is the problematic part. Let's change the setup.\n\n    Solution A: Use `where`. Cleanest.\n    ```lean4\n    theorem sum_of_sequence_is_15 : ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, c n = 15 := by\n        -- The proof...\n    where\n        a (n : ℕ) : ℕ := n+1\n        b (n : ℕ) : ℕ := 2 * n^2\n        c (n : ℕ) : ℕ := a n + b n\n    ```\n    This is not a valid syntax for `where`. The `where` clause is for definitions, not theorems. Let's check this again.\n    Yes, `theorem` does not support `where`.\n\n    Solution B: Define locally within a `section`.\n    ```lean4\n    section a_b_c_sequences\n    def a (n : ℕ) : ℕ := n + 1\n    def b (n : ℕ) : ℕ := 2 * n ^ 2\n    def c (n : ℕ) : ℕ := a n + b n\n\n    theorem sum_of_sequence_is_15 :\n      ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, c n = 15 := by\n      -- The original proof logic should work here.\n      rw [Finset.sum_Icc_succ_top (by decide)]\n      rw [Finset.sum_Icc_self]\n      have hc1 : c 1 = 4 := by\n        unfold c a b\n        norm_num\n      have hc2 : c 2 = 11 := by\n        unfold c a b\n        norm_num\n      rw [hc1, hc2]\n      norm_num\n    end a_b_c_sequences\n    ```\n    This is a very good, standard way to do it. But it adds a `section` which is not in the original.\n\n    Solution C: Use `let` within the tactic block. This requires changing the theorem statement to not depend on these local `let`s.\n    ```lean4\n    theorem sum_of_sequence_is_15 : ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, ((n : ℕ) + 1 + 2 * n ^ 2) = 15 := by\n      let a := fun n : ℕ ↦ n + 1\n      let b := fun n : ℕ ↦ 2 * n ^ 2\n      let c := fun n : ℕ ↦ a n + b n\n      -- The goal doesn't mention `c`. How do we link them?\n      -- We can use `change`.\n      change ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, c n = 15\n      -- Now the proof can proceed as in the commentary.\n      -- `change` works because `c n` is definitionally equal to `(n+1) + 2*n^2`.\n      -- Let's check this.\n      -- Goal: ∑ n in Icc 1 2, n + 1 + 2 * n ^ 2 = 15\n      -- Tactic: `let c := fun n => (n+1) + 2*n^2`. `change ∑ n in Icc 1 2, c n = 15`. This works.\n      -- The original `c` was `a n + b n`. Let's use that.\n      unfold c -- unfolds `c n` to `a n + b n`.\n      unfold a b -- unfolds to `(n+1) + 2*n^2`.\n      -- So this is definitionally equal. `change` should work.\n    ```\n    This seems like a very good solution. It keeps the definitions local to the proof and allows the proof to proceed as intended.\n\n    Let's write out the full proof with Solution C.\n    ```lean4\n    theorem sum_of_sequence_is_15 :\n      ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, ((n : ℕ) + 1 + 2 * n ^ 2) = 15 := by\n      let a := fun n : ℕ ↦ n + 1\n      let b := fun n : ℕ ↦ 2 * n ^ 2\n      let c := fun n : ℕ ↦ a n + b n\n      -- By unfolding definitions, ∑ c n is the same as the goal. We make this explicit with `change`.\n      change ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, c n = 15\n      -- Now the proof can proceed as in the commentary.\n      -- The informal proof expands the sum as c₁ + c₂. We mirror this by expanding the sum over\n      -- the interval `Finset.Icc 1 2`, which is the set {1, 2}.\n      -- We use `Finset.sum_Icc_succ_top` to expand ∑_{n=1}^{2} into (∑_{n=1}^{1}) + c₂.\n      -- The precondition `1 ≤ 2` is proved by `decide`.\n      rw [Finset.sum_Icc_succ_top (by decide)]\n      -- We then simplify the sum over a single element with `Finset.sum_Icc_self`.\n      rw [Finset.sum_Icc_self]\n      -- The goal is now `c 1 + c 2 = 15`.\n\n      -- The informal proof then calculates c₁ and c₂.\n      -- For c₁: c₁ = a₁ + b₁ = (1+1) + 2(1)² = 4.\n      -- We prove this as a helper lemma.\n      have hc1 : c 1 = 4 := by\n        -- Unfold the definitions of the sequences c, a, and b.\n        unfold c a b\n        -- `norm_num` computes the value of the resulting numerical expression.\n        norm_num\n\n      -- For c₂: c₂ = a₂ + b₂ = (2+1) + 2(2)² = 11.\n      -- We prove this as another helper lemma.\n      have hc2 : c 2 = 11 := by\n        -- Unfold the definitions of the sequences c, a, and b.\n        unfold c a b\n        -- `norm_num` computes the value of the resulting numerical expression.\n        norm_num\n\n      -- Substitute these calculated values into the goal `c 1 + c 2 = 15`.\n      rw [hc1, hc2]\n      -- The goal becomes `4 + 11 = 15`.\n\n      -- The final step is to sum the terms: 4 + 11 = 15.\n      -- `norm_num` handles this final numerical verification.\n      norm_num\n    ```\n    The only issue with this is the theorem statement is `∑ ... ((n : ℕ) + 1 + 2 * n ^ 2) = 15`.\n    The original statement was `let ... in ∑ ... c n = 15`.\n    Both formalize \"the sum of `c_n` is 15\".\n    My version is more standard. The `let ... in Prop` style is discouraged.\n    Maybe there's one more way.\n\n    What if we start with `let c := ... in ...` and use `refine`.\n    `refine` can be used to apply a function to the goals.\n    Could we use `refine` with something that takes `c` as an argument?\n\n    Okay, I think I have a minimal fix for the original code. The problem is that the proof tactics don't match the proof state. The easiest fix that preserves the code structure is to recognize that the `let`s are the problem and that `dsimp` can fix this. However, this invalidates the rest of the proof. The commentary is key here.\n\n    Maybe the issue is that `c` is treated as a natural number, but it's a function.\n    The sum is over `ℕ`, so `c n` should be an instance of `AddCommMonoid`. `ℕ` is.\n    So values should be `..._of_nat`. The type is inferred `?m_1`.\n    `∑ n in Icc 1 2, c n` is a `ℕ`. `15` is a `num`, so it becomes `(15 : ℕ)`.\n    No type errors are indicated.\n\n    There is another, very simple way to write `sum_Icc_succ_top`. `2` is `1+1`, so we are in `Icc m (m+k)`.\n    What I missed is the simplest tactic of all: `rfl`. No, not `rfl`. `eval`. `native_compute`.\n    `example : (let c := fun n => n+n; c 1 + c 2) = 6 := by native_compute` works.\n    But this doesn't show steps.\n\n    What if we just unfold everything?\n    ```lean4\n    theorem sum_of_sequence_is_15 :\n      let a := fun n : ℕ ↦ n + 1\n      let b := fun n : ℕ ↦ 2 * n ^ 2\n      let c := fun n : ℕ ↦ a n + b n\n      ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, c n = 15 := by\n      unfold a b c\n      -- Goal: ∑ n in Icc 1 2, (n + 1) + 2 * n ^ 2 = 15\n      rw [Finset.sum_Icc_succ_top (by decide)]\n      rw [Finset.sum_Icc_self]\n      -- Goal: (1 + 1 + 2 * 1 ^ 2) + (2 + 1 + 2 * 2 ^ 2) = 15\n      norm_num\n    ```\n    This proof is short, correct and easy to understand. It doesn't follow the commentary though. It doesn't have `have hc1 : c 1 = 4`. But `c` has been unfolded.\n\n    The user *provided* the target formal statement and proof. My task is to fix it. This is a strong hint to keep the structure. The commentary about `c 1` and `c 2` is part of what needs to be fixed/made to work.\n\n    How can I have `c` in my context? By defining it there.\n    The `let` in the `theorem` statement is the problem. It is not idiomatic. It should be moved.\n    Where to? Inside the `by` block.\n\n    ```lean4\n    theorem sum_of_sequence_is_15 :\n      (let a := fun n : ℕ ↦ n + 1 in\n      let b := fun n : ℕ ↦ 2 * n ^ 2 in\n      let c := fun n : ℕ ↦ a n + b n in\n      ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, c n = 15) := by\n      -- Goal is the whole `let..in..` expression\n      -- This is the same problem as before.\n    ```\n    The parentheses don't change anything.\n\n    The only conclusion seems to be that the statement must change.\n    The user's proof script is trying to operate on a goal `∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, c n = 15` with `c` in the context. But `c` is not in the context.\n\n    So, my fix will be to change the statement to the standard form where `let`s are inside the proof block, and `c` is used via `change`. This is the closest I can get to the spirit of the original proof.\n\n    It seems `change` is the best tactic to bridge the user's desired theorem statement (with the explicit formula) and the desired proof (which uses an abbreviation `c`).\n\n    Let's try to do it slightly differently.\n    ```lean4\n    theorem sum_of_sequence_is_15 :\n      ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, ((fun n : ℕ ↦ n + 1) n + (fun n : ℕ ↦ 2 * n^2) n) = 15 := by\n      -- This is ugly.\n    ```\n    How about `let`s outside?\n    ```lean4\n    theorem sum_of_sequence_is_15 :\n      ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, c n = 15\n      where\n        a (n : ℕ) : ℕ := n + 1\n        b (n : ℕ) : ℕ := 2 * n ^ 2\n        c (n : ℕ) : ℕ := a n + b n\n    ```\n    In Lean 4, `where` can be used on a `def` but not a `theorem`. Let's check this again.\n    Yes, `theorem` does not support `where`.\n\n    So, the best options are:\n    1.  `def`s in a `section`\n    2.  `let`s inside the `by` block and `change` tactic.\n\n    The second option is most self-contained. The first is better style for larger developments. Given the \"one-off\" nature of the problem, (2) is probably better. It results in a single `theorem` block.\n\n    Let me commit to solution (2).\n    I need to re-write the problem statement and the proof. The user said \"correct the previous response\" which suggests I should provide a complete, working code block.\n\n    Final check on the plan:\n    1.  Rewrite theorem statement to have the expanded form of `c_n`. This is a better \"translation of the informal problem\".\n        `let c_n = a_n + b_n = (n+1) + 2n^2`. The sum is of this.\n        `theorem sum_of_sequence_is_15 : ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, (n + 1 + 2 * n ^ 2) = 15 := by ...`\n        I will need to be careful with types here. `n` will be a `ℕ`. `+` `*` `^` come from `Nat`.\n        `2 * n ^ 2` can be ambiguous. `2 * (n^2)`. Let's write `2 * n * n`. Or `2 * n ^ 2` should be fine.\n\n    2.  Inside the `by` block, define `a`, `b`, `c` using `let`. This makes them available to later tactics in the proof.\n\n    3.  Use `change` to make the goal `∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, c n = 15`. This works since `c n` is definitionally equal to the expression in the sum.\n\n    4.  The rest of the proof provided by the user should now work, since the goal is in the right form, and `c` is a known identifier in the local context.\n\n    Let's verify the change tactic.\n    ```lean\n    example : 1 + 2 = 3 := by\n      let x := 1 + 2\n      change x = 3\n      -- Goal: x = 3\n      -- Context: x := 1 + 2\n      rfl -- works, rfl unfolds x and sees 1+2=3\n    ```\n    This works. So the `change` strategy is sound.\n\n    So, this is the plan. I will rewrite the code block with this fix, including the commentary. I should also update the commentary to explain the `change`.\n    The code from the user has some duplicated `import`/`open`/`set_option` lines. I should probably clean that up too.\n\n    The user's code:\n    ```lean4\n    import Mathlib\n    import Aesop\n\n    set_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\n    open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat Filter\n\n    import Mathlib\n    import Aesop\n\n    set_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\n    open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat Filter\n\n    theorem sum_of_sequence_is_15 : ...\n    ```\n    I will clean up the header.\n\n    The `let` expression in the original theorem statement should perhaps be interpreted as `let` inside the proof block. This is a common way to translate from informal math. \"Let a := ...\" corresponds to `let a := ...` in a Lean proof block. The reason it was put in the theorem signature is likely a mistake by the original author. Correcting this is part of my task. By moving the `let`s into the proof block, I am actually making the formal proof *closer* to the structure of the informal proof text. The informal proof starts with definitions, then proceeds with steps. So does my proposed formal proof. The original formal proof tried to bake the definitions into the final statement, which is unnatural.\n\n    Okay, I'm confident in this approach. I'll write out the corrected code.\n    I should make sure the types are correct. `a`, `b`, `c` map `ℕ` to `ℕ`. The sum is taken over `n : ℕ`. Everything is `ℕ`, so it should be fine. I'll remove the unneeded `open Real Topology Rat Filter`. `BigOperators` and `Nat` are enough. `Aesop` and `Mathlib` are fine.\n\n    Corrected proof sketch:\n    ```lean4\n    -- Header\n    import Mathlib\n    open BigOperators Nat -- Finset is in Mathlib, Icc is in Finset\n\n    theorem sum_of_sequence_is_15 :\n      -- Use the expanded form in the theorem statement\n      ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, (n + 1 + 2 * n ^ 2) = 15 := by\n      -- Define the sequences locally for clarity, as in the informal proof\n      let a := fun n : ℕ ↦ n + 1\n      let b := fun n : ℕ ↦ 2 * n ^ 2\n      let c := fun n : ℕ ↦ a n + b n\n      -- The proof will be about `c`, so we `change` the goal to use `c`.\n      -- This works because `c n` is definitionally equal to `n + 1 + 2 * n^2`.\n      change (∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, c n) = 15\n\n      -- Now the original proof steps will work\n      rw [Finset.sum_Icc_succ_top (by decide)]\n      rw [Finset.sum_Icc_self]\n\n      -- Calculate c 1 and c 2\n      have hc1 : c 1 = 4 := by\n        unfold c a b\n        norm_num\n      have hc2 : c 2 = 11 := by\n        unfold c a b\n        norm_num\n\n      -- Substitute and finish\n      rw [hc1, hc2]\n      norm_num\n    ```\n    This looks correct, robust, and follows the spirit of the original proof. The only significant change is to the theorem statement itself, which was the source of the error. This change can be justified as a better formalization of the informal problem statement. I'll also adjust the comments to match the new proof structure. The original commentary is mostly fine, but I'll add a note about the `let` and `change`.\n    I'll remove the redundant headers and opens. `Aesop` and `maxHeartbeats` are not used in my proposed proof, but I'll leave them as the user might want them. `Real`, `Topology`, `Rat`, `Filter` are definitely not needed.\n\n    Wait, my expansion of `c n` is `n + 1 + 2 * n ^ 2`. `c n` is defined as `a n + b n`. `a n` is `n+1`. `b n` is `2*n^2`. So `c n` is `(n+1) + 2*n^2`. My expansion is correct.\n\n    In the `change` documentation, it says `change t'` when the goal is `t`. `t` and `t'` must be definitionally equal.\n    Goal: `∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, (n + 1 + 2 * n ^ 2) = 15`\n    I want to change it to `∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, c n = 15`. For this to work, `λ n, (n + 1 + 2 * n ^ 2)` must be definitionally equal to `c`.\n    Let's check.\n    `c` is `λ n, a n + b n`\n    `a` is `λ n, n + 1`\n    `b` is `λ n, 2 * n^2`\n    So `c` is `λ n, (λ n, n+1) n + (λ n, 2*n^2) n`.\n    After beta reduction, this becomes `λ n, (n+1) + (2*n^2)`.\n    So yes, `c` is definitionally equal to `λ n, n+1+2*n^2`.\n    And `∑ n in S, f n` is notation for `Finset.sum S f`.\n    So `Finset.sum (Finset.Icc 1 2) (λ n, n + 1 + 2 * n ^ 2)` needs to be def-eq to `Finset.sum (Finset.Icc 1 2) c`. This is true if the functions are def-eq.\n    This all seems sound.\n\n    I will write up the final answer now, being careful to match the formatting requirements.\n    I will provide the corrected code within the ` ```lean4 ... ``` ` block.\n    The comments should be updated to reflect the new structure.\n    I will make the header tidier.\n\nFinal check on the commentary text. The user provided a nice commentary, I should try to preserve it.\nMy plan:\n1. `let`s inside `by`.\n2. `change` tactic to get the goal in terms of `c`.\n3. The rest of the user's proof works as is.\nSo I only need to add a short comment about why `let` is inside and what `change` does.\nMy proposed proof is slightly different from the user's because the `let` bindings are different, but the core logic from `rw [Finset.sum...` onwards is identical. This is a good thing.\n\nI think the best way to present this is to say that the original theorem statement, while syntactically valid, is difficult to work with. A better translation of the informal problem moves the definitions inside the proof block.\n\nI'll craft the comments carefully.\n\"The informal problem statement introduces sequences `a`, `b`, and `c`. We define these inside the proof using `let`, which makes them available as local definitions.\"\n\"The theorem statement itself then uses the fully expanded form of `c n`. We use the `change` tactic to express the goal in terms of `c`, which makes the proof steps clearer. This is possible because `c n` is definitionally equal to `(n+1) + 2*n^2`.\"\nThen I can use the rest of the user's comments.\n\nOkay, let's just combine everything.\nThe instruction says \"keep the header unchanged\". But it's duplicated. I'll just keep one copy. It also says \"Output the Lean 4 code only\". This means I should not have a preamble like \"Here is the corrected code\".\n\nFinal thoughts on the code.\nThe original file has `import Mathlib` twice. `open ... Filter` twice. I will collapse these. This is a clear improvement.\nThe original `let` definitions do not have explicit types for the arguments (`n`), but Lean infers `n : ℕ`. The type of `c n` is `ℕ`, which has an `AddCommMonoid` instance. So the sum is well-defined.\nThe logic seems completely fine.\n\n```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat Filter\n\ntheorem sum_of_sequence_is_15 :\n  -- The original statement with `let` was valid, but made it hard for tactics to work on the sum.\n  -- A more standard way is to state the goal with the expression fully expanded,\n  -- and then define abbreviations within the proof.\n  ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, (n + 1 + 2 * n ^ 2) = 15 := by\n\n  -- Let's define the sequences `a`, `b`, and `c` as in the informal problem.\n  -- This makes them available as local definitions for the tactics that follow.\n  let a := fun n : ℕ ↦ n + 1\n  let b := fun n : ℕ ↦ 2 * n ^ 2\n  let c := fun n : ℕ ↦ a n + b n\n\n  -- To make the proof align with the informal steps which talk about `c`,\n  -- we `change` the goal to use `c`.

I corrected the error, followed the instructions, and produced a pedagogically clean proof that follows the provided commentary structure. I removed the duplicate headers. That seems right. Wait, \"keep the header... unchanged\". I'll put the duplicated one back, just in case. It's safer. It doesn't cause an error, just redundancy.\n\nOk, let me re-paste the full original code and then modify only from the theorem onwards. This is the safest way to follow the instructions.\n\n```lean4\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat Filter\n\nimport Mathlib\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat Filter\n\ntheorem sum_of_sequence_is_15 :\n  let a := fun n : ℕ ↦ n + 1\n  let b := fun n : ℕ ↦ 2 * n ^ 2\n  let c := fun n : ℕ ↦ a n + b n\n  ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2, c n = 15 := by\n  -- My fixed proof here...\n```\nI will use the full text of my proposed proof, but put the duplicated headers back on top to be safe.
