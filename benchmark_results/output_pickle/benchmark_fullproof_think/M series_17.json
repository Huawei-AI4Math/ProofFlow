  "original_theorem": "Let the sequence $(a_n)$ be defined by $a_1=1$, $a_2=2$ and the recurrence relation $a_n = \\frac{1}{2}(a_{n-1}+a_{n-2})$ for $n \\geq 3$. Prove that for all integers $n \\geq 1$, the inequality $1 \\leq a_n \\leq 2$ holds.",
  "original_proof": "For $n=1$, we have $a_1=1$. The inequality is $1 \\leq 1 \\leq 2$, which is true. For $n=2$, we have $a_2=2$. The inequality is $1 \\leq 2 \\leq 2$, which is also true. Now for the inductive step, assume the inequality holds for all integers $j$ such that $1 \\leq j \\leq k$ for some integer $k \\geq 2$. So, we assume $1 \\leq a_j \\leq 2$ is true. We must prove the inequality holds for $n=k+1$, i.e., $1 \\leq a_{k+1} \\leq 2$. From the recurrence relation, we have $a_{k+1} = \\frac{1}{2}(a_k+a_{k-1})$. By the inductive hypothesis, we know that $1 \\leq a_k \\leq 2$ and $1 \\leq a_{k-1} \\leq 2$. Adding these two inequalities, we get: $1+1 \\leq a_k+a_{k-1} \\leq 2+2$, which simplifies to $2 \\leq a_k+a_{k-1} \\leq 4$. Now we divide the entire inequality by 2: $\\frac{2}{2} \\leq \\frac{1}{2}(a_k+a_{k-1}) \\leq \\frac{4}{2}$, which simplifies to $1 \\leq a_{k+1} \\leq 2$. This matches the inequality for $n=k+1$. By the principle of **strong mathematical induction**, the inequality $1 \\leq a_n \\leq 2$ holds for all integers $n \\geq 1$.",
