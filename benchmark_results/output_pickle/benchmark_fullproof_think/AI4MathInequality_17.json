  "original_theorem": "Prove that for all positive real numbers $a, b, c$, the following inequality holds: $9(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) \\geq 8(a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca)$.",
  "original_proof": "We want to prove that $9(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) \\ge 8(a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca)$ for positive real numbers $a, b, c$. To do this, consider the difference between the two sides: $9(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) - 8(a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca)$. Expanding each term, we have $9(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) = 9(2abc + a^2b + a^2c + ab^2 + b^2c + ac^2 + bc^2)$ and $8(a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) = 8(a^2b + ab^2 + b^2c + bc^2 + c^2a + ca^2 + 3abc)$. Subtracting the second from the first gives $a(b-c)^2 + b(a-c)^2 + c(a-b)^2$. Since $a, b, c > 0$ and squares of real numbers are non-negative, each term $a(b-c)^2$, $b(a-c)^2$, $c(a-b)^2$ is non-negative, so their sum is non-negative. Therefore, the difference $9(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) - 8(a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) \\ge 0$, which establishes that $9(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) \\ge 8(a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca)$.",
