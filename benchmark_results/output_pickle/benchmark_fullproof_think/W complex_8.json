  "original_theorem": "Let $z$ be a complex number such that $z=x+iy$ for some real numbers $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$. If $(1+i)z + (2-i)\\bar{z} = 4-i$, then $z=2+i$.",
  "original_proof": "From the condition $z=x+iy$, we know its conjugate is $\\bar{z} = x-iy$. We can expand the term $(1+i)z$ as $(1+i)(x+iy) = (x-y) + i(x+y)$. Similarly, we expand the term $(2-i)\\bar{z}$ as $(2-i)(x-iy) = (2x-y) - i(x+2y)$. Substituting these results into the main equation $(1+i)z + (2-i)\\bar{z} = 4-i$ gives $(x-y) + i(x+y) + (2x-y) - i(x+2y) = 4-i$, which simplifies to $(3x-2y) - iy = 4-i$. By equating the real and imaginary parts of this resulting equation, we obtain the system $3x-2y = 4$ and $-y = -1$. Solving this system yields $x=2$ and $y=1$, which implies $z=2+i$.",
