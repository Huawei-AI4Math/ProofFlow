  "original_theorem": "If a nonempty set $S$ of real numbers  is bounded above$,$ then\n$\\sup S$ is the unique real number $\\beta$ such that\n\\begin{alist}\n\\item % (a)\n $x\\le\\beta$ for all $x$ in $S;$\n\\item % (b)\n if $\\epsilon>0$ $($no matter how small$)$$,$ there is an $x_0$ in\n$S$ such that\n$x_0>\n\\beta-\\epsilon.$\n\\end{alist}\n",
  "original_proof": "We first show that $\\beta=\\sup S$ has properties \\part{a} and\n\\part{b}. Since $\\beta$ is an upper bound of $S$, it must satisfy\n\\part{a}. Since any real number $a$ less than $\\beta$ can be written\nas $\\beta-\\epsilon$ with $\\epsilon=\\beta-a>0$, \\part{b} is just\nanother way of saying that no number less than $\\beta$ is an upper\nbound of $S$. Hence, $\\beta=\\sup S$ satisfies \\part{a} and \\part{b}.\nNow we show that there cannot be more than one real number with\nproperties \\part{a} and \\part{b}. Suppose that $\\beta_1<\\beta_2$ and\n$\\beta_2$ has property \\part{b}; thus, if $\\epsilon>0$, there is an\n$x_0$ in $S$ such that $x_0>\\beta_2-\\epsilon$. Then, by taking\n$\\epsilon=\\beta_2-\\beta_1$, we see that there is an $x_0$ in $S$ such\nthat\n$$\nx_0>\\beta_2-(\\beta_2-\\beta_1)=\\beta_1,\n$$\nso  $\\beta_1$ cannot have property \\part{a}. Therefore, there cannot\nbe more than one real number that satisfies both \\part{a} and\n\\part{b}.\n",
