All `import` statements must be at the beginning of the file.\n2.  **Proof Error:** There's a subtle error in the proof of `hG_diff_on_B`. The term `(L.differentiable.differentiableOn.mono hB_sub_N)` is ill-typed because `L.differentiable.differentiableOn` proves `DifferentiableOn ℝ L univ`, and `.mono` would require a proof of `B ⊆ univ`, but `hB_sub_N` is a proof of `B ⊆ N`. The correct term should establish that `L` is differentiable on `B`, which can be done more directly with `L.differentiableOn`.\n\nThe corrected code below addresses these issues by cleaning up the header and fixing the erroneous line in the proof, while keeping the rest of the logic, which is sound, intact.\n\n```lean4\nimport Mathlib.Analysis.Calculus.MeanValue\nimport Mathlib.Analysis.InnerProductSpace.EuclideanSpace\nimport Aesop\n\nset_option maxHeartbeats 0\n\nopen Set Metric Filter Topology\n\n/--\nThis theorem states that a continuously differentiable function `F` on a neighborhood of `x₀`\nis locally Lipschitz continuous with a constant that can be made arbitrarily close to the norm\nof its derivative at `x₀`.\n\nSpecifically, for a function `F: ℝ^n → ℝ^m` that is continuously differentiable on a\nneighborhood `N` of `x₀`, for any `ε > 0`, there exists a `δ > 0` such that for all\n`x, y` in the ball `B_δ(x₀)`, we have `‖F(x) -

F(y)‖ ≤ (‖F'(x₀)‖ + ε) * ‖x - y‖`.\n\nThis is a formalization of Problem 6.2.8 from Trench's \"Introduction to Real Analysis\".\nThe original problem statement uses a strict inequality '<', which does not hold if `x = y`.\nThis formalization uses '≤' to be rigorously correct for all `x, y` in the ball.\nThe core of the proof follows the informal argument by defining an auxiliary function\n`G(x) = F(x) - F'(x₀)(x)` and applying the Mean Value Theorem to `G`.\n-/\ntheorem lipschitz_near_point_of_continuously_differentiable\n    {n m : ℕ} (F : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n) → EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin m)) (x₀ : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n))\n    (N : Set (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n))) (hN : N ∈ nhds x₀) (hF : ContDiffOn ℝ 1 F N) :\n    ∀ ε > 0, ∃ δ > 0, ∀ (x y : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)),\n      x ∈ ball x₀ δ → y ∈ ball x₀ δ →\n      ‖F x -
