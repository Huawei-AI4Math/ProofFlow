  "original_proof": "Suppose $p_1, p_2,\\ldots, p_n$ are distinct primes of the form $4x-1$.  Consider\nthe number\n$$\n      N = 4p_1 p_2  \\cdots  p_n - 1.\n$$\nThen $p_i \\nmid N$ for any~$i$.  Moreover, not every prime $p\\mid N$\nis of the form $4x+1$; if they all were, then $N$ would be of the form\n$4x+1$.  Since $N$ is odd, each prime divisor $p_i$ is odd so\nthere is a $p\\mid N$ that is of the form $4x-1$.  Since\n$p\\not= p_i$ for any~$i$, we have found a new prime of the form\n$4x-1$.  We can repeat this process indefinitely, so the set of primes\nof the form $4x-1$ cannot be finite.\n",
