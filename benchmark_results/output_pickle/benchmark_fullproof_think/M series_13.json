  "original_theorem": "Let $(a_n)$ be a sequence defined by $a_1=2$, $a_2=5$ and the recurrence relation $a_{n} = 5a_{n-1} - 6a_{n-2}$ for $n \\geq 3$. Prove that for all integers $n \\geq 1$, $a_n = 2^{n-1}+3^{n-1}$.",
  "original_proof": "We will prove this by strong mathematical induction on $n$. First, for the base cases, we need to verify the formula holds for $n=1$ and $n=2$. For $n=1$, we are given $a_1=2$. The formula gives $a_1=2^{1-1}+3^{1-1}=2^0+3^0=1+1=2$. This holds. For $n=2$, we are given $a_2=5$. The formula gives $a_2=2^{2-1}+3^{2-1}=2^1+3^1=2+3=5$. This also holds. Now, for the inductive step, we assume the statement is true for all integers $j$ such that $1 \\leq j \\leq k$ for some integer $k \\geq 2$. So, we assume $a_j = 2^{j-1}+3^{j-1}$ for $1 \\leq j \\leq k$. We want to show the statement is true for $k+1$, i.e., $a_{k+1}=2^{k}+3^{k}$. From the recurrence relation, we have $a_{k+1}=5a_k-6a_{k-1}$. By the inductive hypothesis, we can substitute the formulas for $a_k$ and $a_{k-1}$. We have $a_k=2^{k-1}+3^{k-1}$ and $a_{k-1}=2^{k-2}+3^{k-2}$. So, $a_{k+1}=5(2^{k-1}+3^{k-1})-6(2^{k-2}+3^{k-2})$. We expand this: $5 \\cdot 2^{k-1} + 5 \\cdot 3^{k-1} - 6 \\cdot 2^{k-2} - 6 \\cdot 3^{k-2}$. We can rewrite the coefficients. $5 \\cdot 2^{k-1} = (2+3) \\cdot 2^{k-1} = 2 \\cdot 2^{k-1} + 3 \\cdot 2^{k-1} = 2^k + 3 \\cdot 2^{k-1}$. No, that's not right. $5 \\cdot 2^{k-1} = 5 \\cdot 2^{k-2} \\cdot 2 = 10 \\cdot 2^{k-2}$. We have $a_{k+1}=10 \\cdot 2^{k-2} + 15 \\cdot 3^{k-2} - 6 \\cdot 2^{k-2} - 6 \\cdot 3^{k-2}$. Combining like terms gives $(10-6) \\cdot 2^{k-2} + (15-6) \\cdot 3^{k-2} = 4 \\cdot 2^{k-2} + 9 \\cdot 3^{k-2}$. We can simplify this further: $4 \\cdot 2^{k-2} = 2^2 \\cdot 2^{k-2} = 2^k$. And $9 \\cdot 3^{k-2} = 3^2 \\cdot 3^{k-2} = 3^k$. Thus, $a_{k+1}=2^k+3^k$. This matches the formula for $n=k+1$. By the principle of strong mathematical induction, the statement is true for all integers $n \\geq 1$.",
