  "original_theorem": "If $P(A) = 0.6$ and $P(B) = 0.7$, then $P(A \\cap B) \\geq 0.3",
  "original_proof": "We know that $P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B)$. Since $P(A \\cup B) \\leq 1$, we have $P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B) \\leq 1$. Substituting the given values: $0.6 + 0.7 - P(A \\cap B) \\leq 1$, which gives $1.3 - P(A \\cap B) \\leq 1$. Therefore $P(A \\cap B) \\geq 0.3$.",
