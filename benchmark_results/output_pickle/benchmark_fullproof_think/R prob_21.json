  "original_theorem": "If $X_2$ and $X_3$ are independent random variables from exponential distributions with parameters $\\lambda_2$ and $\\lambda_3$, the random variable $Y = \\min(X_2, X_3)$ has an exponential distribution with parameter $\\lambda_2 + \\lambda_3$.",
  "original_proof": "To find the distribution of $Y = \\min(X_2, X_3)$, we can compute its survival function, $P(Y > x)$. This is the probability that both $X_2$ and $X_3$ are greater than $x$. So, $P(\\min(X_2, X_3) > x) = P(X_2 > x \\text{ and } X_3 > x)$. By the independence of $X_2$ and $X_3$, we can write this as $P(X_2 > x)P(X_3 > x)$. Since $X_2$ and $X_3$ are exponential, their survival functions are $P(X_2 > x) = e^{-\\lambda_2 x}$ and $P(X_3 > x) = e^{-\\lambda_3 x}$ for $x > 0$. Multiplying these gives $P(Y > x) = e^{-\\lambda_2 x} e^{-\\lambda_3 x} = e^{-(\\lambda_2 + \\lambda_3)x}$. This is the survival function of an exponential distribution with parameter $\\lambda_2 + \\lambda_3$. Therefore, $Y = \\min(X_2, X_3)$ is an exponential random variable with parameter $\\lambda_2 + \\lambda_3$.",
