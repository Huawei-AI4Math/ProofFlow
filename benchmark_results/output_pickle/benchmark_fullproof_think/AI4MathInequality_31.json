  "original_theorem": "Prove that for all real numbers $x$ and $y$, the following inequality holds: $3(x+y+1)^{2}+1 \\geq 3 x y$.",
  "original_proof": "We want to prove that $3(x+y+1)^{2}+1 \\geq 3xy$ for all real numbers $x,y$. Observe first that for any real numbers $a,b$, the identity $(a+\tfrac{b}{2})^2+\tfrac{3b^2}{4}=a^2+ab+b^2$ shows that $a^2+ab+b^2\\geq 0$, since both terms on the left are non-negative. Now set $a=x+\tfrac{2}{3}$ and $b=y+\tfrac{2}{3}$. Substituting into this inequality gives $(x+\tfrac{2}{3})^2+(x+\tfrac{2}{3})(y+\tfrac{2}{3})+(y+\tfrac{2}{3})^2\\geq 0$. Expanding and simplifying yields $x^2+y^2+xy+2x+2y+\tfrac{4}{3}\\geq 0$, and multiplying through by 3 gives $3x^2+3y^2+3xy+6x+6y+4\\geq 0$. On the other hand, expanding the left-hand side of the target inequality gives $3(x+y+1)^2+1=3x^2+3y^2+6xy+6x+6y+4$. Subtracting $3xy$ from this expression gives exactly $3x^2+3y^2+3xy+6x+6y+4$, which we have already shown is non-negative. Therefore, $3(x+y+1)^2+1\\geq 3xy$ holds for all real $x,y$.",
