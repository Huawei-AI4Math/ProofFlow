  "original_proof": "Suppose that  $T$ is compact and $\\{t_n\\}\\subset T$. If $\\{t_n\\}$\nhas only finitely many distinct terms, there is a $\\overline t$\nin $T$ such that $t_n=\\overline t$ for infinitely many values of $n$;\nif this is so for $n_1<n_2<\\cdots$, then\n$\\lim_{j\\to\\infty}t_{n_j}=\\overline t$. If $\\{t_n\\}$ has infinitely\nmany distinct terms, then $\\{t_n\\}$ has a limit point $\\overline t$ in\n$T$, so there are integers $n_1<n_2<\\cdots$  such that\n$\\rho(t_{n_j},\\overline t)<1/j$; therefore,\n$\\lim_{j\\to\\infty}t_{n_j}=\\overline t$.\nConversely, suppose that  every sequence in $T$ has a\nsubsequence that converges to a limit in $T$.\nIf $S$ is an infinite subset of $T$, we can choose a sequence\n$\\{t_n\\}$ of distinct points in $S$.  By assumption,\n$\\{t_n\\}$ has a subsequence that converges to a member  $\\overline t$\nof $T$. Since $\\overline t$ is a limit point of $\\{t_n\\}$, and\ntherefore of $T$, $T$ is compact.\n",
