  "original_theorem": "Let $X$ be an integrable random variable on a probability space $(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, P)$, and let $\\mathcal{G} \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}$ be a sub-$\\sigma$-algebra. Let the random variable $Y$ be defined as the conditional expectation $Y = E[X | \\mathcal{G}]$. Then, it follows that $E[Y] = E[X]$. Furthermore, if $X$ is $\\mathcal{G}$-measurable, then $Y = X$ almost surely.",
  "original_proof": "By the definition of conditional expectation, for any set $A \\in \\mathcal{G}$, we have the integral equality $\\int_A Y dP = \\int_A X dP$. Since $\\mathcal{G}$ is a sub-$\\sigma$-algebra, it must contain the sample space $\\Omega$. By setting $A = \\Omega$ in the integral equality, we obtain $\\int_\\Omega Y dP = \\int_\\Omega X dP$. The expectation of a random variable is defined as its integral over the entire sample space, which means $E[Y] = \\int_\\Omega Y dP$ and $E[X] = \\int_\\Omega X dP$. From this, we directly conclude that $E[Y] = E[X]$.\n\nFor the second part of the theorem, we assume that $X$ is $\\mathcal{G}$-measurable. To show that $Y=X$ almost surely, we will show that $X$ itself satisfies the two defining properties of the conditional expectation $E[X|\\mathcal{G}]$. The first property is that the random variable must be $\\mathcal{G}$-measurable, which is true for $X$ by our current assumption. The second property is that for any set $A \\in \\mathcal{G}$, the integral of the variable over $A$ must equal the integral of $X$ over $A$. For the variable $X$, this is the identity $\\int_A X dP = \\int_A X dP$, which is trivially true. Because $X$ satisfies both defining properties, $X$ is a version of the conditional expectation $E[X|\\mathcal{G}]$. Given that $Y = E[X | \\mathcal{G}]$ and that conditional expectation is unique almost surely, it must be that $Y = X$ almost surely.",
