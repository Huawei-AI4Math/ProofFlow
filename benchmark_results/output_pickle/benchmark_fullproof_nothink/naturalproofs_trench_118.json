  "original_proof": "Suppose that  each $F_n$ is continuous at $x_0$.\nIf $x\\in S$ and $n\\ge1$, then\n\\begin{equation} \\label{eq:4.4.8}\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n|F(x)-F(x_0)|\\ar\\le  |F(x)-F_n(x)|+|F_n(x)-F_n(x_0)|+|F_n(x_0)-F(x_0)|\n\\\\\n\\ar\\le  |F_n(x)-F_n(x_0)|+2\\|F_n-F\\|_S.\n\\end{array}\n\\end{equation}\nSuppose that  $\\epsilon>0$. Since $\\{F_n\\}$ converges uniformly to $F$\non $S$, we can choose $n$ so that $\\|F_n-F\\|_S<\\epsilon$. For this\nfixed  $n$, \\eqref{eq:4.4.8} implies that\n\\begin{equation} \\label{eq:4.4.9}\n|F(x)-F(x_0)|<|F_n(x)-F_n(x_0)|+2\\epsilon,\\quad x\\in S.\n\\end{equation}\nSince $F_n$ is continuous at $x_0$, there is a $\\delta>0$ such that\n$$\n|F_n(x)-F_n(x_0)|<\\epsilon\\mbox{\\quad if\\quad} |x-x_0|<\\delta,\n$$\nso, from \\eqref{eq:4.4.9},\n$$\n|F(x)-F(x_0)|<3\\epsilon,\\mbox{\\quad if\\quad} |x-x_0|<\\delta.\n$$\nTherefore, $F$ is continuous at $x_0$.
