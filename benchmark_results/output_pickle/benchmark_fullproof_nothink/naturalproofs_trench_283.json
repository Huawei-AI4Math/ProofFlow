  "LLM_output": "The error message indicates that `continuousOn_iff_continuousWithinAt` is not a known identifier or cannot be applied in that context. In Lean 4's `Mathlib`, `ContinuousOn f s` is *defined* as `∀ x ∈ s, ContinuousWithinAt f s x`. So, there's no need to rewrite using `continuousOn_iff_continuousWithinAt`; the goal `ContinuousOn f s` already implicitly means proving `ContinuousWithinAt f s x` for an arbitrary `x ∈ s`.\n\nTherefore, the `rw [continuousOn_iff_continuousWithinAt]` line should be removed.
