  "original_proof": "Since $V(K)=0$,\n$$\n\\int_C\\psi_K(\\mathbf{X})\\,d\\mathbf{X}=0\n$$\nif $C$ is any cube containing $K$. From this and the\ndefinition of the integral, there is a $\\delta>0$ such that if ${\\bf\nP}$ is any partition of $C$ with $\\|{\\bf P}\\|\\le\\delta$ and $\\sigma$\nis any Riemann sum of $\\psi_K$ over ${\\bf P}$, then\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:7.3.6}\n0\\le\\sigma\\le\\epsilon.\n\\end{equation}\n\\newpage\n\\noindent\nNow suppose that  ${\\bf P}=\\{C_1,C_2,\\dots,C_k\\}$ is a partition of $C$\ninto cubes with\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:7.3.7}\n\\|{\\bf P}\\|<\\min (\\rho,\\delta),\n\\end{equation}\nand let $C_1$, $C_2$, \\dots, $C_k$ be numbered so that $C_j\\cap K\\ne\n\\emptyset$ if $1\\le j\\le r$  and\n$C_j\\cap K=\\emptyset$ if $r+1\\le j\\le k$. Then \\eqref{eq:7.3.5} holds, and\na typical Riemann sum of $\\psi_K$ over ${\\bf P}$ is of the form\n$$\n\\sigma=\\sum_{j=1}^r\\psi_K(\\mathbf{X}_j)V(C_j)\n$$\nwith $\\mathbf{X}_j\\in C_j$, $1\\le j\\le r$.
