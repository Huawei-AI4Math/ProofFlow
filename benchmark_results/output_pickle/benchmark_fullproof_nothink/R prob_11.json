  "original_theorem": "Let $Y$ be a random variable with distribution $Y \\sim U(1, 2)$, and let the conditional distribution of $X$ given $Y=y$ be $X | Y=y \\sim U(0, y)$. Then the unconditional expectation of $X$ is $E[X] = 3/4$.",
  "original_proof": "First, we find the conditional expectation $E[X|Y]$. For a given $Y=y$, $X$ is distributed as $U(0, y)$, so its expectation is $E[X|Y=y] = (0+y)/2 = y/2$. Thus, the random variable $E[X|Y]$ is $Y/2$. Next, we find the expectation of $Y$. Since $Y \\sim U(1, 2)$, its expectation is $E[Y] = (1+2)/2 = 3/2$. From this, we can find $E[Y/2]$, which is $(1/2)E[Y] = (1/2) \\cdot (3/2) = 3/4$. Finally, using the formula for total expectation $E[X] = E[E[X|Y]]$, we substitute our results. We have $E[X] = E[Y/2]$, which equals $3/4$.",
