This is captured by `Stream'.IsBounded` or by the fact that `Rat.continuedFraction` returns a `Stream'` which is equivalent to a `List` when bounded. More directly, the `Rat.continuedFraction.partialQuotients` function returns a `List ℕ`. This already implies termination as `List` is a finite type.\nHowever, the problem statement seems to be asking for a proof that *it does* terminate, not just stating a Mathlib feature.\nThe core of the problem is proving that `Rat.continuedFraction.partialQuotients x` is a finite list for any `x : ℚ`.\nThis is essentially what is formalized by `Rat.continuedFraction.terminates`.\n\nHypotheses:\n- `x : ℚ` (x is a rational number)\n\nGoal:\n- The continued fraction procedure for x terminates.\n  This corresponds to `Rat.continuedFraction.terminates x`.\n  Or, equivalently, `(Rat.continuedFraction x).terminated`.\n  Or, even simpler, that the `partialQuotients` of `Rat.continuedFraction x` is a `List`, which it is by definition in Mathlib.\n\nLet's look at `Rat.continuedFraction.terminates x` which is defined as `(Rat.continuedFraction_stream x).terminated`, where `Rat.continuedFraction_stream x` is `Stream'.continuedFractionAux x 0`.\n`Stream'.terminated` is defined as `∃ n, stream n = none`. This means the sequence eventually becomes `none`.\nThe sequence is `Stream'.continuedFractionAux q n : Option ℤ`.\nThe partial quotients are `Stream'.map Rat.continuedFraction_stream.partialQuotient`.\n\nThe proof refers to `Algorithm~\\ref{alg:gcd}`. This typically means the Euclidean algorithm for finding GCD, which is fundamentally finite.\nThe continued fraction algorithm for $x = p/q$ proceeds by `floor x` as $b_0$, and then recursively computes the continued fraction of $1/(x - \\lfloor x \\rfloor)$.\nThe key is that if $x$ is rational, say $x = p/q$, then $x - \\lfloor x \\rfloor = p/q - \\lfloor p/q \\rfloor = (p - q \\lfloor p/q \\rfloor)/q$. Let $r = p - q \\lfloor p/q \\rfloor$. Then $0 \\le r < q$.\nThe new number is $1/(r/q) = q/r$. The denominator has decreased.\nThis process must terminate when the denominator becomes 0 (which means $r=0$, so $x$ is an integer and the remaining fraction is 0) or 1 (which means the number is an integer).\n\nLet's use the definition in Mathlib `Rat.continuedFraction.terminates`. This is true by definition for all rational numbers.\nThe proof in Mathlib for `Rat.continuedFraction.terminates` is `Rat.continuedFraction.terminates_iff_isRational`.\nSo, the problem is essentially asking us to prove `Rat.continuedFraction.terminates_iff_isRational.mpr (by simp)`. Which is tautological given that the input is already a `ℚ`.\n\nThe informal proof steps:\n1. `Let [b_0,b_1,\\ldots, b_m] be the continued fraction representation of x that we obtain using Algorithm~\\ref{alg:gcd}, so the b_i are the partial quotients at each step.`\n   This implies that the representation is finite. The very statement `[b_0, ..., b_m]` assumes it's finite. So it's slightly begging the question.\n   The core of the \"termination\" is showing that this `m` exists.\n\nLet's re-interpret the problem: prove that the standard continued fraction algorithm applied to a rational number `x` produces a finite sequence of partial quotients.\n\nThe formal theorem will simply be `Rat.continuedFraction.terminates x`.\nThe proof provided in Mathlib is `Rat.continuedFraction.terminates x`.\nThis is a pre-proven lemma.\nSo the task is to re-derive this fact within a Lean 4 context, following the informal proof ideas.\n\nInformal proof breakdown:\n- \"Let $x = b_0 + 1/[b_1,\\ldots,b_m]$\": This represents the recursive structure of continued fractions.\n- \"If $m=0$, then $x$ is an integer\": This is the base case. If the continued fraction terminates immediately, $x = b_0$.\n- \"Then $x = b_0 + 1/[b_1,\\ldots,b_m]$\": This is the general step.\n- \"If $[b_1,\\ldots,b_m]=1$, then $m=1$ and $b_1=1$, which will not happen using Algorithm~\\ref{alg:gcd}, since it would give $[b_0+1]$ for the continued fraction of the integer $b_0+1$.\"\n  This means $b_m \\ne 1$ for $m > 0$. This is the \"standard\" convention for continued fractions where the last partial quotient is not 1 when the number is not an integer. Mathlib's `Rat.continuedFraction` follows this convention.\n\nThe key idea for termination on rationals:\nIf $x = p/q$.\n$b_0 = \\lfloor p/q \\rfloor$.\nThe remainder is $r = p \\pmod q$. So $x = b_0 + r/q$.\nThe next number is $y = q/r$. If $r=0$, then $x$ is an integer and the process stops.\nOtherwise, $0 < r < |q|$.\nThe new denominator $r$ is strictly smaller than the previous denominator $q$.\nSince denominators are natural numbers (or positive integers), this process must terminate.\n\nLet's formalize `Rat.continuedFraction.terminates x` using this idea.\nThe Mathlib proof `Rat.continuedFraction.terminates_iff_isRational` relies on `Stream'.continuedFractionAux` and showing its denominator decreases.\n\n```lean4\ntheorem Rat.continuedFraction.terminates (x : ℚ) : (Rat.continuedFraction x).terminated := by\n  -- The definition of `Rat.continuedFraction x` is `Stream'.continuedFractionAux x 0`.\n  -- We need to show `(Stream'.continuedFractionAux x 0).terminated`.\n  -- `Stream'.terminated s` means `∃ n, s n = none`.\n  -- The function `Stream'.continuedFractionAux` is defined by recursion:\n  -- `Stream'.continuedFractionAux x n := if h : x.den ≠ 0 then some (⌊x⌋, 1/(x - ⌊x⌋)) else none`\n  -- This is not quite right. `Stream'.continuedFractionAux x n` is the `n`-th term.\n  -- The sequence is generated by `Stream'.mk'` from an initial state and a next state function.\n  -- In this case for `Rat.continuedFraction_stream`, the state is\n  -- `x_n : ℚ` for which we compute `b_n = ⌊x_n⌋` and the\n  -- next state `x_{n+1} = 1/(x_n - b_n)`.\n  -- The process terminates when `x_n - b_n = 0`, i.e., `x_n` is an integer.\n  -- Or equivalently, when `x_n` becomes `Rat.val 0`.\n\n  -- Mathlib's definition of `terminated`: `Stream'.terminated s ↔ ∃ n, s n = none`.\n  -- The proof in Mathlib for `Rat.continuedFraction.terminates` is `Rat.continuedFraction.terminates_iff_isRational.mpr (by simp)`.\n  -- Let's deconstruct the `terminates_iff_isRational` proof.\n  -- It's `sorry` in `Data/Rat/ContinuedFraction.lean`.

This is captured by `Stream'.IsBounded` or by the fact that `Rat.continuedFraction` returns a `Stream'` which is equivalent to a `List` when bounded. More directly, the `Rat.continuedFraction.partialQuotients` function returns a `List ℕ`. This already implies termination as `List` is a finite type.\nHowever, the problem statement seems to be asking for a proof that *it does* terminate, not just stating a Mathlib feature.\nThe core of the problem is proving that `Rat.continuedFraction.partialQuotients x` is a finite list for any `x : ℚ`.\nThis is essentially what is formalized by `Rat.continuedFraction.terminates`.\n\nHypotheses:\n- `x : ℚ` (x is a rational number)\n\nGoal:\n- The continued fraction procedure for x terminates.\n  This corresponds to `Rat.continuedFraction.terminates x`.\n  Or, equivalently, `(Rat.continuedFraction x).terminated`.\n  Or, even simpler, that the `partialQuotients` of `Rat.continuedFraction x` is a `List`, which it is by definition in Mathlib.\n\nLet's look at `Rat.continuedFraction.terminates x` which is defined as `(Rat.continuedFraction_stream x).terminated`, where `Rat.continuedFraction_stream x` is `Stream'.continuedFractionAux x 0`.\n`Stream'.terminated` is defined as `∃ n, stream n = none`. This means the sequence eventually becomes `none`.\nThe sequence is `Stream'.continuedFractionAux q n : Option ℤ`.\nThe partial quotients are `Stream'.map Rat.continuedFraction_stream.partialQuotient`.\n\nThe proof refers to `Algorithm~\\ref{alg:gcd}`. This typically means the Euclidean algorithm for finding GCD, which is fundamentally finite.\nThe continued fraction algorithm for $x = p/q$ proceeds by `floor x` as $b_0$, and then recursively computes the continued fraction of $1/(x - \\lfloor x \\rfloor)$.\nThe key is that if $x$ is rational, say $x = p/q$, then $x - \\lfloor x \\rfloor = p/q - \\lfloor p/q \\rfloor = (p - q \\lfloor p/q \\rfloor)/q$. Let $r = p - q \\lfloor p/q \\rfloor$. Then $0 \\le r < q$.\nThe new number is $1/(r/q) = q/r$. The denominator has decreased.\nThis process must terminate when the denominator becomes 0 (which means $r=0$, so $x$ is an integer and the remaining fraction is 0) or 1 (which means the number is an integer).\n\nLet's use the definition in Mathlib `Rat.continuedFraction.terminates`. This is true by definition for all rational numbers.\nThe proof in Mathlib for `Rat.continuedFraction.terminates` is `Rat.continuedFraction.terminates_iff_isRational`.\nSo, the problem is essentially asking us to prove `Rat.continuedFraction.terminates_iff_isRational.mpr (by simp)`. Which is tautological given that the input is already a `ℚ`.\n\nThe informal proof steps:\n1. `Let [b_0,b_1,\\ldots, b_m] be the continued fraction representation of x that we obtain using Algorithm~\\ref{alg:gcd}, so the b_i are the partial quotients at each step.`\n   This implies that the representation is finite. The very statement `[b_0, ..., b_m]` assumes it's finite. So it's slightly begging the question.\n   The core of the \"termination\" is showing that this `m` exists.\n\nLet's re-interpret the problem: prove that the standard continued fraction algorithm applied to a rational number `x` produces a finite sequence of partial quotients.\n\nThe formal theorem will simply be `Rat.continuedFraction.terminates x`.\nThe proof provided in Mathlib is `Rat.continuedFraction.terminates x`.\nThis is a pre-proven lemma.\nSo the task is to re-derive this fact within a Lean 4 context, following the informal proof ideas.\n\nInformal proof breakdown:\n- \"Let $x = b_0 + 1/[b_1,\\ldots,b_m]$\": This represents the recursive structure of continued fractions.\n- \"If $m=0$, then $x$ is an integer\": This is the base case. If the continued fraction terminates immediately, $x = b_0$.\n- \"Then $x = b_0 + 1/[b_1,\\ldots,b_m]$\": This is the general step.\n- \"If $[b_1,\\ldots,b_m]=1$, then $m=1$ and $b_1=1$, which will not happen using Algorithm~\\ref{alg:gcd}, since it would give $[b_0+1]$ for the continued fraction of the integer $b_0+1$.\"\n  This means $b_m \\ne 1$ for $m > 0$. This is the \"standard\" convention for continued fractions where the last partial quotient is not 1 when the number is not an integer. Mathlib's `Rat.continuedFraction` follows this convention.\n\nThe key idea for termination on rationals:\nIf $x = p/q$.\n$b_0 = \\lfloor p/q \\rfloor$.\nThe remainder is $r = p \\pmod q$. So $x = b_0 + r/q$.\nThe next number is $y = q/r$. If $r=0$, then $x$ is an integer and the process stops.\nOtherwise, $0 < r < |q|$.\nThe new denominator $r$ is strictly smaller than the previous denominator $q$.\nSince denominators are natural numbers (or positive integers), this process must terminate.\n\nLet's formalize `Rat.continuedFraction.terminates x` using this idea.\nThe Mathlib proof `Rat.continuedFraction.terminates_iff_isRational` relies on `Stream'.continuedFractionAux` and showing its denominator decreases.",
