  "original_proof": "Let $a,b,c>0$ with $abc\\ge 1$. We want to show that $a+b+c \\ge \frac{1+a}{1+b} + \frac{1+b}{1+c} + \frac{1+c}{1+a}$. Observe that $\frac{1+a}{1+b} + \frac{1+b}{1+c} + \frac{1+c}{1+a} = 3 + \frac{a-b}{1+b} + \frac{b-c}{1+c} + \frac{c-a}{1+a} = \frac{(1+a)b}{1+b} + \frac{(1+b)c}{1+c} + \frac{(1+c)a}{1+a}$. By the AM–GM inequality, $\frac{(1+a)b}{1+b} + \frac{(1+b)c}{1+c} + \frac{(1+c)a}{1+a} \\ge 3 \\sqrt[3]{\frac{(1+a)b}{1+b} \\cdot \frac{(1+b)c}{1+c} \\cdot \frac{(1+c)a}{1+a}} = 3\\sqrt[3]{abc} \\ge 3$. Therefore, $a+b+c - \\left(\frac{1+a}{1+b} + \frac{1+b}{1+c} + \frac{1+c}{1+a}\right) \\ge 0$, which gives $a+b+c \\ge \frac{1+a}{1+b} + \frac{1+b}{1+c} + \frac{1+c}{1+a}$.",
