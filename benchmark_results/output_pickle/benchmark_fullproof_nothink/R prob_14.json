  "original_theorem": "Let $X$ and $Y$ be random variables. Suppose the conditional expectation of $X$ given $Y$ is $E[X|Y] = Y^2$, the conditional variance of $X$ given $Y$ is $\\text{Var}(X|Y) = 2$, and $Y$ is a random variable following a continuous uniform distribution on the interval $[0, 3]$. Then, the expectation of $X$ is $E[X] = 3$ and the variance of $X$ is $\\text{Var}(X) = 9.2$.",
  "original_proof": "To find the expectation of $X$, we use the law of total expectation, which states $E[X] = E[E[X|Y]]$. Since $Y$ is uniformly distributed on $[0, 3]$, its probability density function is $f_Y(y) = \\frac{1}{3}$ for $y \\in [0, 3]$. This allows us to compute the second moment of $Y$: $E[Y^2] = \\int_{0}^{3} y^2 (\\frac{1}{3}) dy = 3$. Substituting the given condition $E[X|Y] = Y^2$ into the law of total expectation gives $E[X] = E[Y^2]$. Since we found $E[Y^2] = 3$, it follows that $E[X] = 3$.\n\nTo find the variance of $X$, we use the law of total variance: $\\text{Var}(X) = E[\\text{Var}(X|Y)] + \\text{Var}(E[X|Y])$. From the condition $\\text{Var}(X|Y) = 2$, the first term is $E[\\text{Var}(X|Y)] = E[2] = 2$. For the second term, we require the fourth moment of $Y$, which is $E[Y^4] = \\int_{0}^{3} y^4 (\\frac{1}{3}) dy = 16.2$. Using the variance definition for $E[X|Y] = Y^2$, we get $\\text{Var}(Y^2) = E[Y^4] - (E[Y^2])^2 = 16.2 - 3^2 = 7.2$. Finally, substituting the two components into the law of total variance yields $\\text{Var}(X) = 2 + 7.2 = 9.2$.",
