  "original_proof": "Assume that $a<\\overline{x}<b$; only minor changes in the proof\nare needed if $\\overline{x}=a$ or $\\overline{x}=b$. First, suppose that\n$f$ is continuous at $\\overline{x}$ and $\\{x_n\\}$ is a sequence of\npoints in $[a,b]$ satisfying \\eqref{eq:4.2.7}. If $\\epsilon>0$, there is a\n$\\delta> 0$ such that\n\\begin{equation} \\label{eq:4.2.8}\n|f(x)-f(\\overline{x})|<\\epsilon\\mbox{\\quad if\\quad} |x-\\overline{x}|\n<\\delta.\n\\end{equation}\nFrom \\eqref{eq:4.2.7}, there is an integer $N$ such that\n$|x_n-\\overline{x}|<\\delta$\n if $n\\ge N$. This and \\eqref{eq:4.2.8} imply that\n$|f(x_n)-f(\\overline{x})|<\\epsilon$ if $n\\ge N$. This implies\n\\eqref{eq:4.2.6}, which shows that the stated condition is necessary.\nFor sufficiency, suppose that $f$ is discontinuous at $\\overline{x}$.\nThen there is an $\\epsilon_0>0$ such that, for each positive integer\n$n$, there is a point $x_n$ that satisfies the inequality\n$$\n|x_n-\\overline{x}|<\\frac{1}{ n}\n$$\n\\newpage\n\\noindent\nwhile\n$$\n|f(x_n)-f(\\overline{x})|\\ge\\epsilon_0.\n$$\nThe sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ therefore satisfies \\eqref{eq:4.2.7}, but not\n\\eqref{eq:4.2.6}. Hence,  the stated condition cannot hold if $f$ is\ndiscontinuous at $\\overline{x}$. This proves sufficiency.\n",

Second, it tries to abstract these occurrences of 'a' to create a function 'm := fun _a => ...', called the *motive*, with the property that 'm a' is definitionally equal to 'e'. Third, we observe that 'congrArg' implies that 'm a = m b', which can be used with lemmas such as 'Eq.mpr' to change the goal. However, if 'e' depends on specific properties of 'a', then the motive 'm' might not typecheck.\\n\\nPossible solutions: use rewrite's 'occs' configuration option to limit which occurrences are rewritten, or use 'simp' or 'conv' mode, which have strategies for certain kinds of dependencies (these tactics can handle proofs and 'Decidable' instances whose types depend on the rewritten term, and 'simp' can apply user-defined '@[congr]' theorems as well).\\nx✝ : Sort u_1\\nIcc : x✝\\na b : ℝ\\nhab : a < b\\nf : ℝ → ℝ\\nx₀ : ℝ\\nhx₀ : x₀ ∈ sorry\\nh_LHS_eq_continuousWithinAt : sorry ∧ (x₀ = a → sorry) ∧ (x₀ = b → sorry) ↔ sorry\\n⊢ sorry ∧ (x₀ = a → sorry) ∧ (x₀ = b → sorry) ↔\\n    ∀ (x_n : ℕ → ℝ), (∀ (n : ℕ), x_n n ∈ ?m.450) → Tendsto x_n atTop (𝓝 x₀) → Tendsto (f ∘ x_n) atTop (𝓝 (f x₀))\"}, {'severity': 'error', 'pos': {'line': 39, 'column': 6}, 'endPos': {'line': 39, 'column': 56}, 'data': 'no goals to be solved'}, {'severity': 'error', 'pos': {'line': 45, 'column': 15}, 'endPos': {'line': 45, 'column': 43}, 'data': \"unknown identifier 'Icc_eq_endpoints_or_interior'\"}, {'severity': 'error', 'pos': {'line': 53, 'column': 34}, 'endPos': {'line': 53, 'column': 35}, 'data': \"unknown identifier 'a'\"}, {'severity': 'error', 'pos': {'line': 53, 'column': 27}, 'endPos': {'line': 53, 'column': 30}, 'data': \"unknown identifier 'Ici'\"}, {'severity': 'error', 'pos': {'line': 53, 'column': 49}, 'endPos': {'line': 53, 'column': 50}, 'data': \"unknown identifier 'a'\"}, {'severity': 'error', 'pos': {'line': 53, 'column': 40}, 'endPos': {'line': 53, 'column': 47}, 'data': 'function expected at\\n  Icc\\nterm has type\\n  x✝'}, {'severity': 'error', 'pos': {'line': 76, 'column': 34}, 'endPos': {'line': 76, 'column': 35}, 'data': \"unknown identifier 'b'\"}, {'severity': 'error', 'pos': {'line': 76, 'column': 27}, 'endPos': {'line': 76, 'column': 30}, 'data': \"unknown identifier 'Iic'\"}, {'severity': 'error', 'pos': {'line': 76, 'column': 49}, 'endPos': {'line': 76, 'column': 50}, 'data': \"unknown identifier 'b'\"}, {'severity': 'error', 'pos': {'line': 76, 'column': 40}, 'endPos': {'line': 76, 'column': 47}, 'data': 'function expected at\\n  Icc\\nterm has type\\n  x✝'}, {'severity': 'error', 'pos': {'line': 147, 'column': 8}, 'endPos': {'line': 147, 'column': 12}, 'data': \"tactic 'left' failed, target is not an inductive datatype\\ncase pos\\nx✝ : Sort u_1\\nIcc : x✝\\na b : ℝ\\nhab : a < b\\nf : ℝ → ℝ\\nx₀ : ℝ\\nhx₀ : x₀ ∈ sorry\\nh_CW : sorry\\nh_x₀_interior : a < x₀ ∧ x₀ < b\\n⊢ sorry\"}, {'severity': 'error', 'pos': {'line': 178, 'column': 8}, 'endPos': {'line': 178, 'column': 13}, 'data': \"tactic 'right' failed, target is not an inductive datatype\\ncase neg\\nx✝ : Sort u_1\\nIcc : x✝\\na b : ℝ\\nhab : a < b\\nf : ℝ → ℝ\\nx₀ : ℝ\\nhx₀ : x₀ ∈ sorry\\nh_CW : sorry\\nh_x₀_interior : ¬(a < x₀ ∧ x₀ < b)\\n⊢ sorry\"}, {'severity': 'error', 'pos': {'line': 93, 'column': 2}, 'endPos': {'line': 213, 'column': 35}, 'data': 'unsolved goals\\ncase mpr.right\\nx✝ : Sort u_1\\nIcc : x✝\\na b : ℝ\\nhab : a < b\\nf : ℝ → ℝ\\nx₀ : ℝ\\nhx₀ : x₀ ∈ sorry\\nh_CW : sorry\\n⊢ (x₀ = a → sorry) ∧ (x₀ = b → sorry)'}]} diagnostics=None",

First, it looks for all 'a' in 'e'. Second, it tries to abstract these occurrences of 'a' to create a function 'm := fun _a => ...', called the *motive*, with the property that 'm a' is definitionally equal to 'e'. Third, we observe that 'congrArg' implies that 'm a = m b', which can be used with lemmas such as 'Eq.mpr' to change the goal. However, if 'e' depends on specific properties of 'a', then the motive 'm' might not typecheck.\\n\\nPossible solutions: use rewrite's 'occs' configuration option to limit which occurrences are rewritten, or use 'simp' or 'conv' mode, which have strategies for certain kinds of dependencies (these tactics can handle proofs and 'Decidable' instances whose types depend on the rewritten term, and 'simp' can apply user-defined '@[congr]' theorems as well).\\nx✝ : Sort u_1\\nIcc : x✝\\na b : ℝ\\nhab : a < b\\nf : ℝ → ℝ\\nx₀ : ℝ\\nhx₀ : x₀ ∈ sorry\\nh_LHS_eq_continuousWithinAt : sorry ∧ (x₀ = a → sorry) ∧ (x₀ = b → sorry) ↔ sorry\\n⊢ sorry ∧ (x₀ = a → sorry) ∧ (x₀ = b → sorry) ↔\\n    ∀ (x_n : ℕ → ℝ), (∀ (n : ℕ), x_n n ∈ ?m.450) → Tendsto x_n atTop (𝓝 x₀) → Tendsto (f ∘ x_n) atTop (𝓝 (f x₀))\"}, {'severity': 'error', 'pos': {'line': 39, 'column': 6}, 'endPos': {'line': 39, 'column': 56}, 'data': 'no goals to be solved'}, {'severity': 'error', 'pos': {'line': 50, 'column': 39}, 'endPos': {'line': 50, 'column': 109}, 'data': 'invalid constructor ⟨...⟩, expected type must be an inductive type \\n  Real.lt✝ a x₀'}, {'severity': 'error', 'pos': {'line': 60, 'column': 38}, 'endPos': {'line': 60, 'column': 39}, 'data': \"unknown identifier 'a'\"}, {'severity': 'error', 'pos': {'line': 60, 'column': 35}, 'endPos': {'line': 60, 'column': 36}, 'data': \"unknown identifier 'a'\"}, {'severity': 'error', 'pos': {'line': 60, 'column': 53}, 'endPos': {'line': 60, 'column': 54}, 'data': \"unknown identifier 'a'\"}, {'severity': 'error', 'pos': {'line': 60, 'column': 44}, 'endPos': {'line': 60, 'column': 51}, 'data': 'function expected at\\n  Icc\\nterm has type\\n  x✝'}, {'severity': 'error', 'pos': {'line': 69, 'column': 38}, 'endPos': {'line': 69, 'column': 39}, 'data': \"unknown identifier 'b'\"}, {'severity': 'error', 'pos': {'line': 69, 'column': 35}, 'endPos': {'line': 69, 'column': 36}, 'data': \"unknown identifier 'b'\"}, {'severity': 'error', 'pos': {'line': 69, 'column': 53}, 'endPos': {'line': 69, 'column': 54}, 'data': \"unknown identifier 'b'\"}, {'severity': 'error', 'pos': {'line': 69, 'column': 44}, 'endPos': {'line': 69, 'column': 51}, 'data': 'function expected at\\n  Icc\\nterm has type\\n  x✝'}, {'severity': 'error', 'pos': {'line': 148, 'column': 36}, 'endPos': {'line': 148, 'column': 37}, 'data': \"unknown identifier 'a'\"}, {'severity': 'error', 'pos': {'line': 148, 'column': 33}, 'endPos': {'line': 148, 'column': 34}, 'data': \"unknown identifier 'a'\"}, {'severity': 'error', 'pos': {'line': 148, 'column': 51}, 'endPos': {'line': 148, 'column': 52}, 'data': \"unknown identifier 'a'\"}, {'severity': 'error', 'pos': {'line': 148, 'column': 42}, 'endPos': {'line': 148, 'column': 49}, 'data': 'function expected at\\n  Icc\\nterm has type\\n  x✝'}, {'severity': 'error', 'pos': {'line': 148, 'column': 56}, 'endPos': {'line': 148, 'column': 94}, 'data': \"unknown identifier 'nhdsWithin_Ici_eq_nhdsWithin_Icc_of_lt'\"}, {'severity': 'error', 'pos': {'line': 155, 'column': 36}, 'endPos': {'line': 155, 'column': 37}, 'data': \"unknown identifier 'b'\"}, {'severity': 'error', 'pos': {'line': 155, 'column': 33}, 'endPos': {'line': 155, 'column': 34}, 'data': \"unknown identifier 'b'\"}, {'severity': 'error', 'pos': {'line': 155, 'column': 51}, 'endPos': {'line': 155, 'column': 52}, 'data': \"unknown identifier 'b'\"}, {'severity': 'error', 'pos': {'line': 155, 'column': 42}, 'endPos': {'line': 155, 'column': 49}, 'data': 'function expected at\\n  Icc\\nterm has type\\n  x✝'}, {'severity': 'error', 'pos': {'line': 155, 'column': 56}, 'endPos': {'line': 155, 'column': 94}, 'data': \"unknown identifier 'nhdsWithin_Iic_eq_nhdsWithin_Icc_of_gt'\"}], 'sorries': [{'pos': {'line': 140, 'column': 8}, 'endPos': {'line': 140, 'column': 13}, 'goal': 'case neg\\nx✝ : Sort u_1\\nIcc : x✝\\na b : ℝ\\nhab : a < b\\nf : ℝ → ℝ\\nx₀ : ℝ\\nhx₀ : x₀ ∈ sorry\\nh_CW : sorry\\nh_x₀_interior : ¬(a < x₀ ∧ x₀ < b)\\n⊢ sorry'}]} diagnostics=None",
