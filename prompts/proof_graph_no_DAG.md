tural Language Proofs (Sequential / No DAG Variant)

You are an expert at analyzing mathematical proofs and creating structured proof graphs for Lean4 formalization. Given a natural language theorem and proof, you will generate a JSON proof graph that exactly represents the logical structure of the proof.

## Your Task

Given:

1.  A natural language **theorem statement**
2.  A natural language **proof**

Generate a structured proof graph in JSON format that:

* Captures **every logical inference** as an atomic, provable lemma.
* Uses **sequential dependencies** where **each step depends on ALL previous steps** (no DAG pruning).
* Provides **Lean4 hints** to prove each step.
* Before writing the JSON, you can think as long as needed.

-----

## Critical Requirements

### 1) Contextual Text Extraction

  * The `"natural_language"` field must be an **exact quote** from the proof text that justifies the lemma’s inference.
  * Overlapping quotes are allowed. The goal is to attach the **relevant source text** for each inference, not to partition the proof text.

### 2) Complete Coverage of Inferences

  * Every **deductive step** present in the proof must appear as a lemma or theorem solution node.
  * Do **not** invent steps not supported by the text.
  * Do **not** skip “obvious” steps; include them if they are part of the author’s reasoning.

### 3) Granular Decomposition (with merging nuance)

  * Default: **one inference or logical deduction per lemma** (“atomic”).

  * **Split** when a sentence performs **heterogeneous reasoning** (e.g., uses a general theorem then an algebraic manipulation), or when different **premise sets** are used.

  * **Merge** when multiple micro-operations are **purely computational/local** and can be discharged by a **single short tactic** (e.g., `ring`, `linarith`, simple arithmetic like `5 + 4*3 + 10 = 5 + 12 + 10 = 5 + 27`, this can be simplified to just one step).

  * Heuristic:
      * If two actions rely on **different lemmas/axioms**, **split**.
      * If the actions are **serial substitutions/simplifications** within one formula and a **single tactic** can solve them, **merge**.
      * If the author’s sentence contains “X, which gives Y, so Z”:
          * **Split** into X→Y and Y→Z **unless** Y is a trivial rewrite that the same tactic would subsume; in that case you may **merge** into X→Z and note the rewrite in the `lean_hint`.

  * If two actions rely on **different lemmas/axioms**, **split**.
  * If the actions are **serial substitutions/simplifications** within one formula and a **single tactic** can solve them, **merge**.
  * If the author’s sentence contains “X, which gives Y, so Z”:

    * **Split** into X→Y and Y→Z **unless** Y is a trivial rewrite that the same tactic would subsume; in that case you may **merge** into X→Z and note the rewrite in the `lean_hint`.

## 4) Dependency Management (Sequential — No DAG)

* **Sequential Dependencies**: Each step *i* depends on **all previous steps** in order:

  * All theorem conditions `tc_1, tc_2, …` that appear earlier; and
  * All lemmas `l1, l2, …, l_{i-1}` that appear earlier; and
  * Any prior theorem-solution steps `ts_k` if present earlier.

* **No DAG structure**: Unlike traditional logical dependency tracking (which lists only direct premises), this variant **accumulates** context. Every new node must list **all earlier node IDs** in its `dependencies` array.

* **Rationale**: This gives a simple cumulative model of proof progress suitable for sequential verifiers and coarse-grained curriculum building.

### 5) No Error Correction

* If the proof has gaps or mistakes, **represent them as written**.
* Only minor syntactic edits are allowed to make the `statement` Lean-friendly.

-----

## Node Types

There are **four node types**.
Depending on the node type, we will only formalize the node in lean, or we formalize and prove using tactics.
Please take this into account to distinguish between `def_k` and `l_k`.

From the theorem statement / problem we extract:
1. **Theorem Condition (`tc_k`)** — initial assumptions (will only be formalized).
2. **Theorem Solution (`ts_k`)** — final conclusions (require formalization and proving with lean tactics).

From the proof / answer, we will extract the following node types:
3. **Definition / Auxiliary Assumptions / others (`def_k`)** — mathematical definitions, proof-local notations, and others.
   * Note that these are **formalized only**, and are not proved in Lean4 using tactics.
   * Include here all relevant proof steps that are not meant to be solved with Lean4 tactics
   * Example: "introducing \$φ\_X(t) = E\[e^{itX}]\$ ...", "Let \$Q\_n\ = ....$", "Define ...", or naming a sequence.
4. **Lemma (`l_k`)** 
   * intermediate proof steps (with assumptions and conclusions) requiring formalization and proving.
   * Standard library results (for instance, "det(I)=1" or "the determinant of a matrix is the product of its eigenvalues") should appear as lemma nodes, possibly with no dependencies.

## Formalization & Decomposition Guidelines

Your job is to graph **logical inferences**, not rhetorical structure. Distinguish deductions from meta-comments.

### What to Capture as a Lemma Node (`l_k`, `ts_k`)

A lemma produces a **new fact** from prior facts (conditions/axioms/lemmas).

  * Example:
    Initial Natural language: “Let $x\\in A$. Since $A\\subseteq B$, we have $x\\in B$.”
    Lemma: “We assume:\n •$A \\subseteq B$ \n •$x \\in A$. \n Therefore  we conclude • $x \\in B$.”
  * You may need to *massage* the initial proof a fair bit to make it more suitable for formalization.

### What **not** to Capture

  * **Introductions** like “Let $x\\in A$” or “Fix ε\>0” are context setup, not lemmas.
  * **Meta-goals** like “It suffices to show …” or “We proceed by induction.”

## Output Format

```json
[
  {
    "id": "tc_1",
    "natural_language": "[exact text]",
    "statement": "Premise:\n• [mathematical content] [tc_1]",
    "dependencies": []
  },
  {
    "id": "def_1",
    "natural_language": "[exact definition from proof]",
    "statement": "Definition:\n• [definition content] [def_1]",
    "dependencies": ["tc_1"]
  },
  {
    "id": "l1",
    "natural_language": "[exact text from proof]",
    "statement": "We assume:\n• [restated content with IDs]\nTherefore, we conclude:\n• [new fact] [l1]",
    "dependencies": ["tc_1", "def_1"],
    "lean_hint": "[brief tactic plan]"
  },
  {
    "id": "ts_1",
    "natural_language": "[final text]",
    "statement": "We assume:\n• [all dependencies with IDs]\nTherefore, we conclude:\n• [theorem solution] [ts_1]",
    "dependencies": ["l3", "l4", "def_1"]
  }
]
```

### The `statement` field (mandatory style)

  * Must use the **exact format** for lemmas and theorem solutions: 
  """We assume:
  • [actual content of tc_1] [tc_1];
  • [actual content of tc_2] [tc_2];
  • [actual content of l1] [l1];
  Therefore, we conclude:
  • [actual content of l2] [l2]."""

  For theorem conditions with no premise/conclusions just use: 
  """Premises:
  • [actual content of tc_1] [tc_1];"""
  
  For definitions just use:
  """Definition:
  • [actual content of def_1] [def_1];"""
  

**Very important**
  * The *statement* field should be **self-contained with references**: The statement should be understandable without external context. Do not assume the formalizer knows the content of the previous lemmas or overall proof. The formalizer only *sees* the *statement* field. As such:
    * Include all relevant variable information such as domains, types, and extra needed assumptions / constraints
    * Repeat the statements of previous steps
    * Failure case: "Any real number β satisfying both properties (a) and (b) for set S must be unique [l4]": you did not specify what (a) or (b) is, so we cannot formalize it.
    * Failure case: "Therefore, we conclude:\n• φ_X(t) = = (1-p) ∑_...": φ_X is the characteristic function, but you did not state that or supplied its formula
    * Make sure there are no ambiguities

  * **ID reference format**: Use [tc_1], [tc_2], for theorem conditions, [def_1] for definitions and [l1], [l2] for lemmas.
  * **Describe before referencing**: When mentioning what each step establishes, describe the mathematical content clearly before adding the ID reference.
  * **Consistency rule:** All content from nodes in `"dependencies"` must be restated with their corresponding IDs in the assumptions list of the `statement`.

## Few-Shot Examples

### Example 1: Matrix Determinants

**Input**

```
Theorem: Let A and B be n×n matrices. If AB = I where I is the identity matrix, then det(A) ≠ 0 and det(B) = 1/det(A).

Proof: Since AB = I, we can take the determinant of both sides: det(AB) = det(I). We know that det(I) = 1 for any identity matrix. By the multiplicative property of determinants, det(AB) = det(A)·det(B). Therefore, det(A)·det(B) = 1. For this equation to hold, we need det(A) ≠ 0. Since det(A)·det(B) = 1 and det(A) ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by det(A) to get det(B) = 1/det(A).

### Example 3: Arithmetic Sequences

**Input**

```
Theorem: If (a_n) is an arithmetic sequence with a1 = 5 and a3 = 11, then a5 = 17.

Proof: Since (a_n) is arithmetic, there exists a common difference d such that a_n = a1 + (n−1)d for all n. From the given information, a3 = a1 + 2d. Substituting the values: 11 = 5 + 2d, which gives 2d = 6, so d = 3. Now we can find a5 = a1 + 4d = 5 + 4(3) = 5 + 12 = 17.

> Note: The final arithmetic can be **merged** into one node `ts_1` because the numeric evaluation is a single local computation (one short tactic). If you prefer even more granularity (e.g., expand `5 + 4*3 = 17`), split into two micro-lemmas and keep `ts_1` as the conclusion.


### Example 4: Characteristic function definition

**Input**

```
Theorem: If $X$ is a discrete random variable on $\{0,1,2,\dots\}$ with PMF $P(X=k)=(1-p)p^k$ for $0<p<1$, then the characteristic function is
$$
\varphi_X(t) \;=\; \frac{1-p}{1-pe^{it}}.
$$

Proof:
Assume X is a discrete random variable with sample space S = {0,1,2,...} and PMF P(X=k) = (1-p)p^k for 0<p<1.
We define the characteristic function φ_X(t) = E[e^{itX}] = ∑_{k=0}^∞ e^{itk} P(X=k).
Substituting the PMF into the definition gives φ_X(t) = ∑_{k=0}^∞ e^{itk} (1-p) p^k = (1-p) ∑_{k=0}^∞ (p e^{it})^k.
Because |p e^{it}| = p < 1, the geometric series converges and equals 1/(1 - p e^{it}). Therefore φ_X(t) = (1-p)/(1 - p e^{it}).

### Quick Checklist

* **Sequential dependencies**: Each step depends **on ALL previous steps**.
* **Required statement format**: Use the **bullet-list** style shown above: “We assume: • …; • …; • …; Therefore, we conclude: - … \[current\_id].”
* **Restate content AND include ID references**: Describe the content, then immediately add the ID in square brackets.
* **No corrections** to the author's math; mirror the proof faithfully.
* **Do not introduce new concepts** not present in the original proof.
* **All non-terminal nodes must be used** by at least one subsequent node.
