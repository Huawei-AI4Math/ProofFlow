The expectation of the discrete random variable $Y$ is $E[Y] = (1)(p) + (-1)(1-p) = 2p-1$. From the definition $Z = X+Y$ and the linearity of expectation, it follows that $E[Z] = E[X] + E[Y]$. Substituting the computed expectations gives $E[Z] = \\frac{1}{2} + 2p - 1 = 2p - \\frac{1}{2}$, which proves the first conclusion.\n\nNext, we determine the conditional expectation. From $Z = X+Y$ and the linearity of conditional expectation, we have $E[Z|Y] = E[X|Y] + E[Y|Y]$. Due to the independence of $X$ and $Y$, we know that $E[X|Y] = E[X]$, and it is a fundamental property that $E[Y|Y] = Y$. Substituting these properties into our expression for the conditional expectation, we get $E[Z|Y] = E[X] + Y$. Using our previously calculated value for $E[X]$, we arrive at the second conclusion: $E[Z|Y] = Y + \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the variance of this conditional expectation. From our result for the second conclusion, it follows that $Var(E[Z|Y]) = Var(Y + \\frac{1}{2})$. A key property of variance is that adding a constant to a random variable does not change its variance, which means $Var(Y + \\frac{1}{2}) = Var(Y)$. By combining these last two steps, we establish the third conclusion: $Var(E[Z|Y]) = Var(Y)$.",

Then, we have the tower property $E[E[X | \\mathcal{G}_2] | \\mathcal{G}_1] = E[X | \\mathcal{G}_1]$ almost surely. As a direct consequence, the law of total expectation holds: $E[E[X | \\mathcal{G}_2]] = E[X]$.",

To prove the main theorem, we need to show that $Y_1$ is a version of the conditional expectation of $Y_2$ given $\\mathcal{G}_1$. This requires verifying the two defining properties of conditional expectation.\n\nFirst, by the definition of $Y_1 = E[X | \\mathcal{G}_1]$, the random variable $Y_1$ is $\\mathcal{G}_1$-measurable. This is the first property.\n\nSecond, for the integral property, the definition of $Y_1$ also states that for any set $A \\in \\mathcal{G}_1$, we have $\\int_A Y_1 dP = \\int_A X dP$. Similarly, from the definition of $Y_2 = E[X | \\mathcal{G}_2]$, for any set $B \\in \\mathcal{G}_2$, we have $\\int_B Y_2 dP = \\int_B X dP$. \n\nNow, consider any set $A \\in \\mathcal{G}_1$. From the given condition that $\\mathcal{G}_1 \\subseteq \\mathcal{G}_2$, it follows that $A$ is also an element of $\\mathcal{G}_2$. Since $A \\in \\mathcal{G}_2$, we can apply the property of $Y_2$ to set $A$, which gives $\\int_A Y_2 dP = \\int_A X dP$. By comparing this with the integral property of $Y_1$, we see that for any $A \\in \\mathcal{G}_1$, we have $\\int_A Y_1 dP = \\int_A Y_2 dP$. \n\nSince $Y_1$ is $\\mathcal{G}_1$-measurable and satisfies $\\int_A Y_1 dP = \\int_A Y_2 dP$ for all $A \\in \\mathcal{G}_1$, $Y_1$ is by definition the conditional expectation of $Y_2$ given $\\mathcal{G}_1$. Thus, $Y_1 = E[Y_2 | \\mathcal{G}_1]$, which means $E[X | \\mathcal{G}_1] = E[E[X | \\mathcal{G}_2] | \\mathcal{G}_1]$ almost surely. This proves the first part of the theorem.\n\nFor the second part, recall that for the trivial $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{G}_{\\text{trivial}} = \\{\\emptyset, \\Omega\\}$, the conditional expectation $E[Y | \\mathcal{G}_{\\text{trivial}}]$ is the constant $E[Y]$ for any integrable random variable $Y$.

By differentiating this series with respect to $a$, we find that $\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty k a^k = \\frac{a}{(1-a)^2}$.

So $S_1 = 1^3$, which holds. Now, for the inductive step, we assume the statement is true for some integer $k \\geq 1$, which means $S_k = k^3$. We want to show that the statement is true for $k+1$, i.e., $S_{k+1} = (k+1)^3$. We know that $S_{k+1} = S_k + a_{k+1}$. From the inductive hypothesis, $S_k = k^3$, and we have $a_{k+1} = 3(k+1)^2-3(k+1)+1$. So we need to show that $k^3 + 3(k+1)^2-3(k+1)+1 = (k+1)^3$. We expand the terms on the left side: $3(k+1)^2 = 3(k^2+2k+1) = 3k^2+6k+3$. Also, $-3(k+1) = -3k-3$. So the left side becomes $k^3 + (3k^2+6k+3) + (-3k-3) + 1 = k^3 + 3k^2+3k+1$.

    "nl_proof": "First, we find the general formulas for the sequences $(a_n)$ and $(b_n)$. For the arithmetic sequence $(a_n)$, the general formula is $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$. Given $a_2=7$ and $a_5=16$, we can form a system of equations: $7=a_1+d$ and $16=a_1+4d$. Subtracting the first equation from the second gives $9=3d$, so $d=3$. Substituting $d=3$ into the first equation gives $7=a_1+3$, so $a_1=4$. Thus, the general formula for $a_n$ is $a_n=4+(n-1)3=3n+1$. For the geometric sequence $(b_n)$, the general formula is $b_n = b_1 \\cdot r^{n-1}$. Given $b_2=12$ and $b_4=48$, we have $12=b_1 r$ and $48=b_1 r^3$. Dividing the second equation by the first gives $\\frac{b_1 r^3}{b_1 r} = \\frac{48}{12}$, so $r^2=4$, which implies $r=2$. Substituting $r=2$ into the first equation gives $12=b_1(2)$, so $b_1=6$. Thus, the general formula for $b_n$ is $b_n=6 \\cdot 2^{n-1}$. Now, we consider the generic term of the series, $\\frac{1}{a_n \\cdot b_n} = \\frac{1}{(3n+1)(6 \\cdot 2^{n-1})}$. We need to show that $C_N = \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\frac{1}{(3n+1)(6 \\cdot 2^{n-1})} < \\frac{1}{6}$. The first term is $C_1 = \\frac{1}{(3(1)+1)(6 \\cdot 2^{1-1})} = \\frac{1}{4 \\cdot 6} = \\frac{1}{24}$. The inequality holds for $N=1$. We can prove the inequality by comparing the series with a geometric series. For $n \\geq 1$, we have $3n+1 \\geq 4$. Therefore, $\\frac{1}{(3n+1)(6 \\cdot 2^{n-1})} \\leq \\frac{1}{4(6 \\cdot 2^{n-1})} = \\frac{1}{24 \\cdot 2^{n-1}} = \\frac{1}{24} (\\frac{1}{2})^{n-1}$.

For $n=2$, the formula gives $a_2 = \\frac{3^2-1}{2} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4$. This matches the given value of $a_2=4$. Now for the inductive step, assume the formula holds for all integers $j$ where $1 \\leq j \\leq k$ for some integer $k \\geq 2$. So, we assume $a_j = \\frac{3^j-1}{2}$ is true.
